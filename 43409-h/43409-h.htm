<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>The present volume contains two contrasting treatises.
The first is religious, and shows in Count Tolstoï's earnest
and eloquent manner the meaning of Christ's words
which he takes for his text,&mdash;"The Kingdom of God
is within you." The outward forms of religion, however
helpful they may be to some souls, are not essential;
the superstitions with which Faith sometimes
clothes or masks herself may or may not be uplifting;
but the foundation of Christianity is the truth contained
in Christ's words, his simple, plain, undogmatic commands
and prohibitions.</p>

<p>One word sums it all up, and that word is Love. If
the world should take love for its guiding star, it is
evident that all the evils of the world would cease,&mdash;wars,
crimes, poverty, ambitions; the millennium would
come! Count Tolstoï shows how that blessed period
may begin in every man. The translation of this beautiful
and inspiring book has been made by Mrs. Aline
Delano of Boston.</p>

<p>In answering the question, "What is Art?" Count
Tolstoï analyzes and tests the various definitions given
by other writers. He shows up with merciless severity
what he considers the fallacy in the popular delusion
that the fetish of Art pardons bestiality, obscenity, and
whatever conduces to stimulating the passions. The
work is strongly controversial, and attacks unsparingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
many of the popular notions of the day, as, for instance,
that "Art is the manifestation of some mysterious idea
of God," or "the expression of man's emotions by external
signs," or the production of pleasing objects.
He believes that art has a loftier function, and he proceeds
elaborately to argue in favor of this universal
activity, which should be to effect a union among men
so that they may have the same noble feelings and
progress together toward universal and individual well-being.
"Art for art's sake" is meaningless to him. It
is interesting to notice that the most original and independent
of the French critics has recently taken practically
the same ground in a lecture, in which he asserts
that it is the critic's business to test art and literature,
and that art has a most intimate relation with morality.</p>

<p>Much of the book is racy and amusing; much of it is
abstruse, and requires close attention. But whether one
follows the author in his individual opinions or not, it
cannot be denied that the general tone of the treatise
is helpful and uplifting, and that it is based on sound
common sense. Mr. Aylmer Maude of England is the
translator of this work, and has had the benefit of
Count Tolstoï's own suggestions in regard to certain
points. As the special preface explains, the translation
accurately represents the author's views, while the edition
published in Russia was in many ways garbled and
distorted. The translators of both treatises have seized
the opportunity of carefully revising their work.</p>

<h2>AUTHOR'S PREFACE</h2>


<p>In this book I have endeavored to show that our
modern Christianity has been tried and found wanting,
that the armed camp of Europe is not Christian,
but Pagan, as is latter-day religion, of which the present
state of affairs is the outcome. The book contains
three principal ideas,&mdash;the first, that Christianity is not
only the worship of God and a doctrine of salvation, but
is, above all things, a new conception of life, which is
changing the whole fabric of human society; the second,
that from the first appearance of Christianity there entered
into it two opposite currents,&mdash;the one establishing
the true and new conception of life, which it gave
to humanity, and the other perverting the true Christian
doctrine and converting it into a Pagan religion, and
that this contradiction has attained in our days the highest
degree of tension which now expresses itself in universal
armaments, and on the Continent in general
conscription; and the third, that this contradiction,
which is masked by hypocrisy, can only be solved by
an effort of sincerity on the part of every individual
endeavoring to conform the acts of his life,&mdash;independent
of what are regarded as the exigencies of
family, society, and the State,&mdash;with those moral principles
which he considers to be true.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTORY" id="INTRODUCTORY">INTRODUCTORY</a></h2>

<p>In 1884 I wrote a book entitled "My Religion," wherein
I formulated my creed.</p>

<p>While affirming my faith in the doctrine taught by
Christ, I could not refrain from manifesting at the same
time the reason why I look upon the ecclesiastical doctrine
commonly called Christianity as erroneous, and to
me incredible.</p>

<p>Among the many deviations of the latter from the
doctrine of Christ, I called attention to the principal
one; namely&mdash;the evasion of the commandment that
forbids man to resist evil by violence, as a striking example
of the perversion of the doctrine of Christ by
ecclesiastical interpretation.</p>

<p>I knew but little, no more than other men, of what had
been taught or written on the subject of non-resistance
in former times. I was familiar with the opinions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the Fathers of the Church, Origen, Tertullian, and
others; and I also knew of the existence of certain sects
called Mennonites, Herrnhuters, and Quakers, all of
which forbid Christians the use of arms, and will not
submit to conscription, but I never knew the arguments
by which these sects sought to maintain their views.</p>

<p>My book, as I had anticipated, was prohibited by the
Russian censors, but partly in consequence of my reputation
as a writer, partly because it excited curiosity, it
had a circulation in manuscript, and while, on the one
hand, it called forth from those persons who sympathized
with my ideas, information concerning works
written on the same subject, on the other, it excited
criticisms on the opinions therein maintained.</p>

<p>These two results, together with the historical events
of recent years, made many things clear to me, and led
me to many new deductions and conclusions which I
now desire to set forth.</p>

<p>I shall speak in the first place of the information I
received in regard to the history of this matter of non-resistance
to evil; and in the second place, of the arguments
upon the subject offered by religious critics, that
is, by critics who profess the religion of Christ, as well
as those of secular critics, that is to say, of men who
make no such profession; and finally, the conclusions
which I drew from the arguments of both parties, as
well as from the historical events of later years.</p>

<h3>DOCTRINE OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL FROM THE
ORIGIN OF CHRISTIANITY, HAS BEEN, AND STILL IS,
PROFESSED BY THE MINORITY OF MEN</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Concerning the book "My Religion"&mdash;Information called forth by this
book&mdash;Letters of Quakers&mdash;Professions of Garrison&mdash;Adin Ballou, his
works and Catechism&mdash;"The Net of Faith" of Helchitsky&mdash;Relations of
men toward works that explain the teachings of Christ&mdash;The book of
Dymond "On War"&mdash;Assertion of Non-resistance by Musser&mdash;Relations
of government in 1818 toward those who refuse to join the military
service&mdash;General inimical attitude of governments and liberal men
toward those who refused to take part in the violence of governments
and their conscious effort to conceal and ignore these demonstrations
of Christian Non-resistance.</p></blockquote>


<p>Among the early responses called forth by my book
were letters from American Quakers. In these
letters, while expressing their sympathy with my ideas
in regard to the unlawfulness of violence and war where
Christians are concerned, the Quakers made known to
me many details in relation to their sect, which for
more than two hundred years has professed the doctrine
of Christ in the matter of non-resistance, and which
never has, nor does it now use weapons for self-defense.
Together with the letters, the Quakers sent me many
of their pamphlets, periodicals, and books. From these
publications I learned that already, many years ago,
they had demonstrated the Christian's duty of keeping
the commandment of non-resistance to evil by violence,
and the error of the church which countenances wars
and executions.</p>

<p>Having shown by a succession of arguments and texts
that war&mdash;the slaughter and mutilation of men&mdash;is
inconsistent with a religion founded on peace and good-will
to men, the Quakers go on to assert that nothing is
so conducive to the defamation of Christ's truth in the
eyes of the heathen, or so successful in arresting the
spread of Christianity throughout the world, as the refusal
to obey this commandment, made by men who call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
themselves Christians, and by the sanction thus given to
war and violence. The doctrine of Christ, which has
entered into the consciousness of men, not by force or
by the sword, as they say, but by non-resistance to evil,
by humility, meekness, and the love of peace, can only
be propagated among men by the example of peace, love,
and concord given by its followers.</p>

<p>A Christian, according to the teaching of the Lord,
should be guided in his relations toward men only by
the love of peace, and therefore there should be no
authority having power to compel a Christian to act in a
manner contrary to God's law, and contrary to his chief
duty toward his fellow-men.</p>

<p>The requirements of the civil law, they say, may oblige
men, who, to win some worldly advantages, seek to conciliate
that which is irreconcilable, to violate the law of
God; but for a Christian, who firmly believes that his
salvation depends upon following the teaching of Christ,
this law can have no meaning.</p>

<p>My acquaintance with the activity of the Quakers and
with their publications, with Fox, Paine, and particularly
with a work published by Dymond in 1827, proved to
me not only that men have long since recognized the
impossibility of harmonizing Christianity and war, but
that this incompatibility has been proved so clearly
and irrefragably, that one can only wonder how it is
possible for this incongruous union of Christianity with
violence&mdash;a doctrine which is still taught by the church&mdash;to
remain in force.</p>

<p>Besides the information obtained from the Quakers, I
also received from America about the same time advices
on the subject from another and hitherto unknown source.
The son of William Lloyd Garrison, the famous anti-slavery
champion, wrote to me that, having read my book,
wherein he had found ideas similar to those expressed
by his father in 1838, and taking it for granted that
I should be interested to know that fact, he sent me
a book written by Mr. Garrison some fifty years ago,
entitled "Non-resistance."</p>

<p>This avowal of principle took place under the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
circumstances:&mdash;In 1838, on the occasion of a meeting
of the Society for the Promotion of Peace, William Lloyd
Garrison, while discussing means for the suppression of
war, arrived at the conclusion that the establishment of
universal peace can have no solid foundation save in the
literal obedience to the commandment of non-resistance
by violence (Matthew v. 39), as understood by the Quakers,
with whom Garrison was on friendly terms. Having
arrived at this conclusion, he wrote, offering to the
Society the following proclamation, which at that time,
in 1838, was signed by many of its members:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">"<em>Declaration of Sentiments adopted by the Peace Convention,
held in Boston, September 18, 19, and 20,
1838</em>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Assembled in Convention, from various sections of
the American Union, for the promotion of Peace on earth
and Good-will among men, We, the undersigned, regard
it as due to ourselves, to the cause which we love, to the
country in which we live, and to the world, to publish a
Declaration, expressive of the principles we cherish, the
purposes we aim to accomplish, and the measures we
shall adopt to carry forward the work of peaceful, universal
reformation.</p>

<p>"We cannot acknowledge allegiance to any human
government; neither can we oppose any such government
by a resort to physical force. We recognize but
one King and Lawgiver, one Judge and Ruler of mankind.
We are bound by the laws of a Kingdom which
is not of this world; the subjects of which are forbidden
to fight; in which Mercy and Truth are met together,
and Righteousness and Peace have kissed each other;
which has no state lines, no national partitions, no geographical
boundaries; in which there is no distinction of
rank or division of caste, or inequality of sex; the officers
of which are Peace, its exactors Righteousness, its walls
Salvation, and its gates Praise; and which is destined to
break in pieces and consume all other kingdoms. Our
country is the world, our countrymen are all mankind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
We love the land of our nativity only as we love all
other lands. The interests, rights, liberties of American
citizens are no more dear to us than are those of the
whole human race. Hence, we can allow no appeal to
patriotism to revenge any national insult or injury; the
Principle of Peace, under whose stainless banner we
rally, came not to destroy, but to save, even the worst
of enemies. He has left us an example, that we should
follow His steps. God commendeth his love toward
us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for
us.</p>

<p>"We conceive that if a nation has no right to defend
itself against foreign enemies, or to punish its invaders,
no individual possesses that right in his own case. The
unit cannot be of greater importance than the aggregate.
If one man may take life, to obtain or defend his rights,
the same license must necessarily be granted to communities,
states, and nations. If <em>he</em> may use a dagger
or a pistol, <em>they</em> may employ cannon, bombshells, land
and naval forces. The means of self-preservation must
be in proportion to the magnitude of interests at stake,
and the number of lives exposed to destruction. But if
a rapacious and bloodthirsty soldiery, thronging these
shores from abroad, with intent to commit rapine and
destroy life, may not be resisted by the people or magistracy,
then ought no resistance to be offered to domestic
troubles of the public peace or of private security.
No obligation can rest upon Americans to regard foreigners
as more sacred in their persons than themselves,
or to give them a monopoly of wrong-doing with
impunity.</p>

<p>"The dogma, that all the governments of the world
are approvingly ordained of God, and that the powers
that be in the United States, in Russia, in Turkey, are
in accordance with His will, is not less absurd than
impious. It makes the impartial Author of human
freedom and equality unequal and tyrannical. It cannot
be affirmed that the powers that be, in any nation,
are actuated by the spirit or guided by the example of
Christ, in the treatment of enemies; therefore, they cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
be agreeable to the will of God; and therefore their
overthrow, by a spiritual regeneration of their subjects,
is inevitable.</p>

<p>"We register our testimony not only against all wars,
whether offensive or defensive, but all preparations
for war; against every naval ship, every arsenal, every
fortification; against the militia system and a standing
army; against all military chieftains and soldiers;
against all monuments commemorative of victory over
a fallen foe, all trophies won in battle, all celebrations
in honor of military or naval exploits; against all appropriations
for the defense of a nation by force and
army, on the part of any legislative body; against every
edict of government requiring of its subjects military
service. Hence we deem it unlawful to bear arms, or
to hold a military office.</p>

<p>"As every human government is upheld by physical
strength, and its laws are enforced virtually at the
point of the bayonet, we cannot hold any office which
imposes upon its incumbent the obligation to compel
men to do right, on pain of imprisonment or death.
We therefore voluntarily exclude ourselves from every
legislative and judicial body, and repudiate all human
politics, worldly honors, and stations of authority. If
we cannot occupy a seat in the legislature or on the
bench, neither can we elect <em>others</em> to act as our substitutes
in any such capacity.</p>

<p>"It follows that we cannot sue any man at law, to
compel him by force to restore anything which he may
have wrongfully taken from us or others; but if he
has seized our coat, we shall surrender up our cloak,
rather than subject him to punishment.</p>

<p>"We believe that the penal code of the old covenant,
'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth,' has been
abrogated by Jesus Christ; and that under the new
covenant, the forgiveness instead of the punishment
of enemies has been enjoined upon all His disciples,
in all cases whatsoever. To extort money from enemies,
or set them upon a pillory, or cast them into
prison, or hang them upon gallows, is obviously not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
forgive, but to take retribution. 'Vengeance is mine,
I will repay, saith the Lord.'</p>

<p>"The history of mankind is crowded with evidences
proving that physical coercion is not adapted to moral
regeneration; that the sinful disposition of men can be
subdued only by love; that evil can be exterminated
from the earth only by goodness; that it is not safe to
rely upon an arm of flesh, upon man whose breath is
in his nostrils, to preserve us from harm; that there
is great security in being gentle, harmless, long-suffering,
and abundant in mercy; that it is only the meek
who shall inherit the earth, for the violent who resort
to the sword are destined to perish with the sword.
Hence, as a measure of sound policy&mdash;of safety to
property, life, and liberty&mdash;of public quietude and private
enjoyment&mdash;as well as on the ground of allegiance
to Him who is King of kings and Lord of lords, we cordially
adopt the non-resistance principle; being confident
that it provides for all possible consequences, will
insure all things needful to us, is armed with omnipotent
power, and must ultimately triumph over every assailing
force.</p>

<p>"We advocate no jacobinical doctrine. The spirit of
jacobinism is the spirit of retaliation, violence, and murder.
It neither fears God nor regards man. We would
be filled with the spirit of Jesus Christ. If we abide by
our principles, it is impossible for us to be disorderly, or
plot treason, or participate in any evil work; we shall
submit to every ordinance of man, for the Lord's sake;
obey all the requirements of government, except such as
we deem contrary to the commands of the gospel; and
in no case resist the operation of law, except by meekly
submitting to the penalty of disobedience.</p>

<p>"But while we shall adhere to the doctrine of non-resistance
and passive submission, we purpose, in a moral
and spiritual sense, to speak and act boldly in the cause
of God; to assail iniquity in high places and in low
places; to apply our principles to all existing civil,
political, legal, and ecclesiastical institutions; and to
hasten the time when the kingdoms of this world will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of His
Christ, and He shall reign forever.</p>

<p>"It appears to us a self-evident truth, that, whatever
the gospel is designed to destroy at any period of the
world, being contrary to it, ought now to be abandoned.
If, then, the time is predicted when swords shall be
beaten into plowshares, and spears into pruning-hooks,
and men shall not learn the art of war any more, it follows
that all who manufacture, sell, or wield those
deadly weapons do thus array themselves against the
peaceful dominion of the Son of God on earth.</p>

<p>"Having thus briefly stated our principles and purposes,
we proceed to specify the measures we propose
to adopt in carrying our object into effect.</p>

<p>"We expect to prevail through the foolishness of
preaching,&mdash;striving to commend ourselves unto every
man's conscience, in the sight of God. From the press
we shall promulgate our sentiments as widely as practicable.
We shall endeavor to secure the coöperation of
all persons, of whatever name or sect. The triumphant
progress of the cause of Temperance and of Abolition
in our land, through the instrumentality of benevolent
and voluntary associations, encourages us to combine
our own means and efforts for the promotion of a still
greater cause. Hence, we shall employ lecturers, circulate
tracts and publications, form societies, and petition
our state and national governments, in relation to the subject
of Universal Peace. It will be our leading object
to devise ways and means for effecting a radical change
in the views, feelings, and practices of society, respecting
the sinfulness of war and the treatment of enemies.</p>

<p>"In entering upon the great work before us, we are
not unmindful that, in its prosecution, we may be called
to test our sincerity even as in a fiery ordeal. It may
subject us to insult, outrage, suffering, yea, even death
itself. We anticipate no small amount of misconception,
misrepresentation, calumny. Tumults may arise against
us. The ungodly and violent, the proud and pharisaical,
the ambitious and tyrannical, principalities and powers,
and spiritual wickedness in high places, may contrive to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
crush us. So they treated the Messiah, whose example
we are humbly striving to imitate. If we suffer with
Him we know that we shall reign with Him. We shall
not be afraid of their terror, neither be troubled. Our
confidence is in the Lord Almighty, not in man. Having
withdrawn from human protection, what can sustain
us but that faith which overcomes the world? We shall
not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is
to try us, as though some strange thing had happened
unto us; but rejoice, inasmuch as we are partakers
of Christ's sufferings. Wherefore, we commit the
keeping of our souls to God, in well-doing, as unto a
faithful Creator. For every one that forsakes house,
or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or
children, or lands, for Christ's sake, shall receive a
hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.</p>

<p>"Firmly relying upon the certain and universal
triumph of the sentiments contained in this declaration,
however formidable may be the opposition arrayed
against them&mdash;in solemn testimony of our faith
in their divine origin&mdash;we hereby affix our signatures
to it, commending it to the reason and conscience of
mankind, giving ourselves no anxiety as to what may
befall us, and resolving in the strength of the Lord
God calmly and meekly to abide the issue."</p></blockquote>

<p>Later on, Garrison founded a Non-resistance Society
and started a periodical entitled <cite>The Non-resistant</cite>,
wherein the full significance and consequences of the
doctrine were plainly set forth, as has been stated in
the proclamation. I gained, subsequently, further information
concerning the fate of this society and the
periodical from a biography of William Lloyd Garrison,
written by his sons.</p>

<p>Neither the periodical nor the society enjoyed a long
life. The majority of Garrison's associates in the
work of liberating the slaves, apprehensive lest the
too radical views expressed in the <cite>The Non-resistant</cite>
might alienate men from the practical business of the
abolition of slavery, renounced the doctrine of non-resistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
as expressed in the declaration, and both
periodical and society passed out of existence.</p>

<p>One would suppose that this declaration of Garrison,
formulating, as it did, an important profession of faith
in terms both energetic and eloquent, would have made
a deeper impression on men, and have become a subject
for universal consideration. On the contrary, not
only is it unknown in Europe, but even among those
Americans who honor the memory of Garrison there
are but few who are familiar with this.</p>

<p>A similar fate befell another American champion
of the same doctrine, Adin Ballou, who died recently,
and who for fifty years had preached in favor of non-resistance
to evil. How little is known in regard to the
question of non-resistance may be gathered from the
fact that the younger Garrison (who has written an
excellent biography of his father in four large volumes),
in answer to my inquiry whether any society
for the defense of the principles of non-resistance was
yet alive and possessed adherents, wrote me that, so
far as he knew, the society had dissolved and its members
were no longer interested, while at this very time
Adin Ballou, who had shared Garrison's labors, and
who had devoted fifty years of his life to the teaching
of the doctrine of non-resistance, both by pen and by
tongue, was still living in Hopedale, Massachusetts.
Afterward I received a letter from Wilson, a disciple
and co-worker of Ballou, and subsequently I entered
into correspondence with Ballou himself. I wrote to
him, and he sent me his works, from one of which I
made the following extract:&mdash;"Jesus Christ is my
Lord and Master," says Ballou in one of his articles,
written to show the inconsistency of Christians who
believe in the right of defensive and offensive warfare.
"I have covenanted to forsake all and follow Him,
through good and evil report, until death. But I am
nevertheless a Democratic Republican citizen of the
United States, implicitly sworn to bear true allegiance
to my country, and to support its Constitution, if need
be, with my life. Jesus Christ requires me to do unto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
others as I would that others should do unto me. The
Constitution of the United States requires me to do
unto twenty-seven hundred thousand slaves" (they had
slaves then; now they could easily be replaced by
workmen) "the very contrary of what I would have
them do unto me&mdash;viz., assist to keep in a grievous
bondage.... But I am quite easy. I vote on. I
help govern on. I am willing to hold any office I
may be elected to under the Constitution. And I am
still a Christian. I profess on. I find difficulty in
keeping covenant both with Christ and the Constitution.</p>

<p>"Jesus Christ forbids me to resist evil-doers by taking
'eye for eye, tooth for tooth, blood and life for
life.' My government requires the very reverse, and
depends, for its own self-preservation, on the halter, the
musket, and the sword, seasonably employed against
its domestic and foreign enemies.</p>

<p>"In the maintenance and use of this expensive life-destroying
apparatus we can exemplify the virtues <em>of
forgiving our injuries, loving our enemies, blessing them
that curse us, and doing good to those that hate us</em>. For
this reason we have regular Christian chaplains to pray
for us and call down the smiles of God on our holy
murders.</p>

<p>"I see it all" (that is, the contradiction between profession
and life), "and yet I insist that I am as good a
Christian as ever. I fellowship all; I vote on; I help
govern on; I profess on; <em>and I glory in being at once a
devoted Christian and a no less devoted adherent to the
existing government</em>. I will not give in to those miserable
non-resistant notions. I will not throw away my political
influence, and leave unprincipled men to carry on
government alone.</p>

<p>"The Constitution says&mdash;'Congress shall have power
to declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal,'
and I agree to this, I indorse it. I swear to help carry
it through. I vote for men to hold office who are sworn
to support all this. What, then, am I less a Christian?
Is not war a Christian service? Is it not perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Christian to murder hundreds of thousands of fellow
human beings; to ravish defenseless females, sack and
burn cities, and enact all the other cruelties of war?
Out upon these new-fangled scruples! This is the very
way to forgive injuries, and love our enemies! If we
only do it all in true love nothing can be more Christian
than wholesale murder!"</p>

<p>In another pamphlet, entitled "How many does it
take?" he says&mdash;"One man must not kill. If he does,
it is murder; two, ten, one hundred men, acting on their
responsibility, must not kill. If they do, it is still
murder. But a state or nation may kill as many as
they please, and it is no murder. It is just, necessary,
commendable, and right. Only get people enough to
agree to it, and the butchery of myriads of human
beings is perfectly innocent. But how many does it
take? This is the question. Just so with theft, robbery,
burglary, and all other crimes. Man-stealing is a
great crime in one man, or a very few men only. But
a whole nation can commit it, and the act becomes not
only innocent, but highly honorable."</p>

<p>The following is, in substance, a catechism of Ballou,
compiled for the use of his congregation:&mdash;</p>


<p class="center">THE CATECHISM OF NON-RESISTANCE.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Whence comes the word non-resistance?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> From the utterance: "But I say unto you, That
ye resist not evil."&mdash;Matthew v. 39.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> What does this word denote?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> It denotes a lofty Christian virtue, commanded
by Christ.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Are we to understand the word non-resistance in
its broad sense, that is, as meaning that one should offer
no resistance to evil whatsoever?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> No; it should be understood literally as Christ
taught it&mdash;that is, not to return evil for evil. Evil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
should be resisted by all lawful means, but not by
evil.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> From what does it appear that Christ gave that
meaning to non-resistance?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> From the words which he used on that occasion.
He said: "Ye have heard that it hath been said, An
eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. But I say unto
you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite
thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. And
if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy
coat, let him have thy cloke also."</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Whom did he mean by the words: "Ye have heard
that it hath been said"?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> The patriarchs and the prophets, and that which
they spoke and which is contained in the Old Testament,
that the Jews generally call the Law and Prophets.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> To what laws did Christ allude in the words: "Ye
have heard"?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> To those in which Noah, Moses, and other prophets
grant the use of personal violence against those who commit
it, for the purpose of punishing and destroying evil
deeds.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Mention such commandments.</p>

<p><em>A.</em> "Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his
blood be shed."&mdash;Genesis ix. 6.</p>

<p>"He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely
put to death. And if any mischief follow, then thou
shalt give life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand
for hand, foot for foot, burning for burning, wound for
wound, stripe for stripe."&mdash;Exodus xxi. 12, 23, 24, 25.</p>

<p>"And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to
death. And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbor;
as he hath done, so shall it be done to him; breach for
breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth."&mdash;Leviticus xxiv.
17, 19, 20.</p>

<p>"And the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and,
behold, if the witness be a false witness, and hath testified
falsely against his brother; then shall ye do unto
him, as he had thought to have done unto his brother.
And thine eye shall not pity; but life shall go for life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot."&mdash;Deuteronomy
xix. 18, 19, 21.</p>

<p>These are the injunctions of which Jesus speaks.</p>

<p>Noah, Moses, and the prophets taught that he who
murders, mutilates, or tortures his neighbor doeth evil.
In order to combat and destroy this evil, the evil-doer
must be chastised by death, mutilation, or some personal
torture. Transgressions are to be avenged by transgressions,
murder by murder, torture by torture, evil by evil.
Thus taught Noah, Moses, and the prophets. But Christ
forbids all this. The gospel says: "I say unto you, resist
ye not evil, avenge not one transgression by another,
but rather bear a repetition of the offense from the evil-doer."
That which has been allowed is now forbidden.
Having understood what resistance we have been
taught, we know exactly what Christ meant by non-resistance.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Did the teaching of the Ancients admit of resisting
transgression by transgression?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Yes; but Christ forbade it. A Christian has no
right in any case to take the life of, or to offend against,
the evil-doer.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> May he not kill or wound another in self-defense?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> No.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> May he enter a complaint to the magistrates for
the purpose of chastising the offender?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> No. For that which he does through others, he
practically does himself.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> May he fight in the army against foreign or domestic
enemies?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Certainly not. He can take no part in war, or in
the preparation therefor. He cannot make use of weapons.
He cannot resist one transgression by another,
whether he is alone or in company, either personally or
through other agents.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> May he voluntarily select or drill soldiers for the
government?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> He cannot do this, if he wishes to be <em>faithful</em> to
the law of Christ.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> May he voluntarily contribute money to assist a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
government which is supported by military power, executions,
and violence in general?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> No; unless the money is to be used for some special
purpose, justifiable in itself, where the object and the
means employed are good.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> May he pay taxes to such a government?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> No; he should not pay taxes on his own accord,
but he should not resist the levying of a tax. A tax imposed
by the government is levied independently of the
will of the citizens. It may not be resisted without
recourse to violence, and a Christian should not use
violence; therefore he must deliver his property to the
forced damage caused by authorities.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> May a Christian vote at elections and take part in
courts of law or in the government?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> No. To take a part in elections, courts of law, or
in the administration of government is the same thing as
a participation in the violence of the government.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> What is the chief significance of the doctrine of
non-resistance?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> To show that it is possible to extirpate evil from
one's own heart, as well as from that of one's neighbor.
This doctrine forbids men to do that which perpetuates
and multiplies evil in this world. He who attacks another,
and does him an injury, excites a feeling of hatred,
the worst of all evil. To offend our neighbor because he
has offended us, with ostensible motive of self-defense,
means but to repeat the evil act against him as well as
against ourselves,&mdash;it means to beget, or at least to let
loose, or to encourage the Evil Spirit whom we wish to
expel. Satan cannot be driven out by Satan, falsehood
cannot be purged by falsehood, nor can evil be conquered
by evil. True non-resistance is the only real method of
resisting evil. It crushes the serpent's head. It destroys
and exterminates all evil feeling.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But admitting that the idea of the doctrine is correct,
is it practicable?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> As practicable as any virtue commanded by the
law of God. Good deeds cannot be performed under all
circumstances without self-sacrifice, privations, suffering,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and, in extreme cases, without the loss of life itself. But
he who prizes life more than the fulfilment of God's will
is already dead to the only true life. Such a man, in trying
to save his life, will lose it. Furthermore, wherever
non-resistance costs the sacrifice of one's life, or of some
essential advantage of life, resistance costs thousands of
such sacrifices.</p>

<p><em>Non-resistance preserves; resistance destroys.</em></p>

<p>It is much safer to act justly than unjustly; to endure
an offense rather than resist it by violence; safer even in
regard to the present life. If all men refused to resist
evil, the world would be a happy one.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But if only a few were to act thus, what would
become of them?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Even if but one man were to act thus, and the
others should agree to crucify him, would it not be more
glorious for him to die in the glory of non-resisting love,
praying for his enemies, than live wearing the crown of
Cæsar, besprinkled with the blood of the murdered? But
whether it be one man or thousands of men who are
firmly determined not to resist evil by evil, still, whether
in the midst of civilized or uncivilized neighbors, men
who do not rely on violence are safer than those who
do. A robber, a murderer, a villain, will be less likely
to harm them if he finds them offering no armed resistance.
"All they that take the sword shall perish with
the sword," and he who seeks peace, who acts like a
friend, who is inoffensive, who forgives and forgets injuries,
generally enjoys peace, or if he dies, he dies a
blessed death.</p>

<p>Hence, if all were to follow the commandment of
non-resistance, there would manifestly be neither offense
nor evil-doing. If even the majority were composed of
such men they would establish the rule of love and
good-will even toward the offenders, by not resisting
evil by evil nor using violence. Even if such men
formed a numerous minority, they would have such an
improving moral influence over society that every severe
punishment would be revoked, and violence and enmity
would be replaced by peace and good-will. If they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
formed but a small minority, they would rarely experience
anything worse than the contempt of the world,
while the world, without preserving it or feeling grateful
therefor, would become better and wiser from its
latent influence. And if, in the most extreme cases,
certain members of the minority might be persecuted
unto death, these men, thus dying for the truth, would
have left their doctrine already sanctified by the blood
of martyrdom.</p>

<p>Peace be with all ye who seek peace; and may the all-conquering
love be the imperishable inheritance of every
soul who submits of its own accord to the law of Christ.</p>

<p><em>Resist not evil by violence.</em>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Adin Ballou.</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For fifty years Ballou wrote and published books
chiefly on the subject of non-resistance. In these writings,
remarkable for their eloquence and simplicity of
style, the question is considered in all its aspects. He
proved it to be the duty of every Christian who professes
to believe that the Bible is a revelation from
God, to obey this commandment. He enumerates the
arguments against the commandment of non-resistance,
drawn from the Old as well as the New Testament, the
expulsion from the Temple, among others, and answers
each one in turn. Setting the Bible aside, he points out
the practical good sense on which this principle is
founded, sums up the arguments against it, and refutes
them. For instance, in one chapter of his work he
treats of non-resistance to evil in exceptional cases, and
affirms that granting the truth of the supposition that
there are cases to which the rule of non-resistance cannot
be applied, that would prove that the rule in general
is inconsistent. Citing such exceptional cases, he proves
that these are the very occasions when the application
of this rule is both wise and necessary. The question
has been viewed from every side, and no argument,
whether of opponent or sympathizer, has been neglected
or left unanswered. I mention this in order to call
attention to the deep interest which works of this class
ought to excite in men who profess Christianity; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
it would seem therefore that Ballou's zeal should have
been recognized, and the ideas he expressed either
accepted or disproved. But such was not the case.</p>

<p>The life-work of Garrison, the father, his founding the
society of the Non-resistant, and his declaration, convinced
me, more even than my intercourse with the
Quakers, that the divergence of the Christianity of the
State from Christ's law of non-resistance by violence
has been long since noticed and pointed out, and men
have labored and still do labor to counteract it. Thus
Ballou's earnestness has fortified my opinion. But
the fate of Garrison, and particularly that of Ballou,
almost unknown, notwithstanding fifty years of active
and persistent work in one direction, has confirmed me
in the belief that there exists a certain inexpressed but
fixed determination to oppose all such attempts by a
wall of silence.</p>

<p>In August of 1890 Ballou died, and his obituary
appeared in the American <cite>Religio-Philosophical Journal</cite>
of August 23d.</p>

<p>From this obituary we learn that Ballou was the spiritual
leader of a community, that he had preached from
8000 to 9000 sermons, married 1000 couples, and written
500 articles, but in regard to the object of his life's
devotion not a word is said; the word "non-resistance"
is never mentioned.</p>

<p>All the exhortations of the Quakers for 200 years, all
the efforts of Garrison, the father, the foundation of his
society, his periodical, and his declarations, as well as
the life-work of Ballou, are the same as if they had
never existed.</p>

<p>Another striking example of the obscurity into which
a work written for the purpose of explaining the principle
of non-resistance, and to denounce those who refuse
to recognize this commandment, may fall, is the fate of
a book by the Czech Helchitsky, which has only recently
been discovered, and which up to the present time has
never been printed.</p>

<p>Shortly after the publication of my book in German, I
received a letter from a professor of the Prague University,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
who wrote to tell me of a book which had never
been printed, a work written in the fifteenth century by
the Czech Helchitsky, and entitled "The Net of Faith."
In this work, written four centuries ago, Helchitsky, as the
professor tells me, has expressed exactly the same opinion
in regard to true and false Christianity that I did in
my work entitled "My Religion." The professor wrote
that the work of Helchitsky was to appear in print for
the first time in the Czech language in one of the publications
of the St. Petersburg Academy of Science. As
I was unable to obtain the book, I endeavored to ascertain
all that was known of Helchitsky himself, and this
knowledge I gained from a German book sent to me by
the same professor in Prague. Besides that I learned
something from Pipin's "History of Czech Literature."
Pipin says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"'The Net of Faith' is the doctrine of Christ, wherewith
man is to be raised from the gloomy depths of the
social sea of iniquity. True faith is to believe the words
of God; but we are living in times when men call the
true faith heresy; hence it is upon our own reason that
we must rely to discover the truth if we possess it not.
Darkness has concealed it from men, and they no longer
recognize the true law of Christ.</p>

<p>"As an illustration of the law, Helchitsky cites the
original social organization of Christian society, which
is considered by the Church of Rome of the present
time as rank heresy.</p>

<p>"This primitive church was his own ideal of a social
order founded upon equality, liberty, and fraternity.
Christianity, according to Helchitsky, still preserves this
foundation, and has but to return to its pure teaching to
render any other social order, whose existence requires
the authority of pope or king, quite superfluous. The
law of love will suffice for all....</p>

<p>"Historically, Helchitsky assigns the decadence of
Christianity to the time of Constantine the Great, whom
the Pope Silvester received into the Church in spite of
his pagan life and morals. Constantine, in return, rewarded
the Pope by endowing him with riches and temporal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
power. Since then these two forces have played
into each other's hands, seeking only outward glory.
Doctors, men of learning, and the clergy, caring only to
maintain their influence over the world, excited the nations
one against the other, encouraging the crimes of
murder and rapine, and thus destroying Christianity,
both in faith and practice. Helchitsky totally denies
the right of man to wage war or to exact the penalty
of death. According to him, every soldier, even if he
be a 'knight,' is only a transgressor, a criminal, and a
murderer."</p></blockquote>

<p>All this, with the addition of some biographical details
and extracts from the correspondence of Helchitsky,
is related in the German book.</p>

<p>Having thus become acquainted with the essence of
Helchitsky's teachings, I waited with still greater impatience
the appearance of "The Net of Faith" in the
Academy's periodical. But one, two, three years passed,
and the book was not forthcoming. It was only in 1888
that I learned that the printing had been suspended.
I obtained the proof-sheets of what had been printed,
and read them. In many respects it was a wonderful
book.</p>

<p>Its contents have been accurately summarized by
Pipin. Helchitsky's principal idea is that Christianity,
in league with sovereignty during the reign of Constantine
the Great, and continuing to develop under these
conditions, became corrupted, and ceased to be Christianity.
He called his book "The Net of Faith" because
he had chosen for his motto that verse from the New
Testament which speaks of the disciples as fishers of
men. He carries on the simile thus: "Through His
disciples, Christ caught the world in the net of His
faith, but the larger fishes, breaking the net, escaped;
then others followed through these same holes made by
the large fishes, and the net was left almost empty."
By the big fish he means the popes, emperors, and sovereigns
who, without giving up their authority, accepted
Christianity, not in its reality, but in its semblance.</p>

<p>Helchitsky teaches the same doctrine that is now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
taught by the non-resistant Mennonites and Quakers,
and in former times by the Bogomiles, the Paulicians,
and other sects. He teaches that Christianity, requiring,
as it does from its followers, humility, gentleness, a forgiving
spirit, the turning of the other cheek when one
is struck, and the love of one's enemies, is not compatible
with that violence which is an essential element of
authority. A Christian, according to Helchitsky, should
not only refuse to be a commander or a soldier, but he
should take no part in government, neither should he
become a tradesman, nor even a landowner. He might
be an artisan or a farmer. This book is among the few
which have been saved from the flame into which books
denouncing official Christianity were commonly cast.
As all such so-called heretical works were usually
burned with their authors, very few of those which denounce
official Christianity have been preserved&mdash;and
for this reason the book of which we speak has a
special interest.</p>

<p>But apart from its interest, concerning which there
may be differences of opinion, it is one of the most remarkable
results of human thought, both on account
of its profundity and the wonderful power and beauty
of its language, not to mention its antiquity. And yet
this book has remained unprinted for centuries, and
continues to be unknown except to a few specialists. (<em>See
Note, end of Chapter.</em>)</p>

<p>One would think that works like these of the Quakers,
of Garrison, of Ballou, and of Helchitsky,&mdash;which affirm
and prove by the authority of the Bible that the world
misinterprets the teaching of Christ,&mdash;would arouse an
interest, would make a sensation, would give rise to discussions
between the clergy and their flocks.</p>

<p>One might suppose that works which deal with the
very essence of the Christian doctrine would be reviewed,
and either acknowledged to be just, or else
refuted and condemned.</p>

<p>Not at all. Every one of these works suffers the same
fate. Men of widely differing opinions, believers, and,
what is still more surprising, unbelieving liberals, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
though by common consent, preserve an obstinate silence
in regard to them. Thus every attempt to explain the
true meaning of Christ's doctrine goes for nothing.</p>

<p>And more astonishing still is the ignorance concerning
two works whose existence was made known to me after
the publication of my own book. One is a work by
Dymond, "On War," printed for the first time in London
in 1824, and the other by Daniel Musser, entitled "Non-resistance
Asserted," was written in 1864.</p>

<p>The ignorance in regard to these books is amazing;
the more so, that apart from their merit, both treat, not
so much of the theory as of its practical application to
life; of the relations of Christianity to military service,
which is particularly interesting in view of the system
of conscription. It may be asked, perhaps, what action
is befitting for a subject who believes that war is incompatible
with religion when his government calls upon
him for military service?</p>

<p>One would take this to be a vital question, whose
answer, in view of our present system of conscription,
becomes one of serious importance. All men, or the
majority of mankind, are Christians, and every male
is required to do military duty. How man, in his
Christian character, is to meet this demand, Dymond
gives the following reply:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>It is his duty, mildly and temperately, yet firmly, to
refuse to serve.</em></p>

<p>"There are some persons who, without any determinate
process of reasoning, appear to conclude that
responsibility for national measures attaches solely to
those who direct them; that it is the business of governments
to consider what is good for the community, and
that, in these cases, the duty of the subject is merged
in the will of the sovereign. Considerations like these
are, I believe, often voluntarily permitted to become
opiates of the conscience. I have no part, it is said, in
the councils of the government, and am not, therefore,
responsible for its crimes. We are, indeed, not responsible
for the crimes of our rulers, but we are responsible
for our own; and the crimes of our rulers are our own,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
if, whilst we believe them to be crimes, we promote
them by our coöperation....</p>

<p>"Those who suppose that obedience in all things is
required, or that responsibility in political affairs is transferred
from the subject to the sovereign, reduce themselves
to a great dilemma. It is to say that we must
resign our conduct and our consciences to the will of
others, and act wickedly, or well, as their good or evil
may preponderate, without merit for virtue or responsibility
for crime."</p>

<p>It is worthy of notice that the same is expressed in a
maxim to soldiers, which they are required to memorize.
Dymond says that only a commander answers for the
consequences of his order. But this is unjust. A man
cannot remove the responsibility for his actions from
himself. And this is evident from the following: "If
your superior orders you to kill your child, your neighbor,
your father, or your mother, will you obey? If
you will not, there is an end of the argument; for if
you may reject his authority in one instance, where is
the limit to rejection? There is no rational limit but
that which is assigned by Christianity, and that is both
rational and practicable....</p>

<p>"We think, then, that it is the business of every man
who believes that war is inconsistent with our religion,
respectfully, but steadfastly, to refuse to engage in it.
Let such as these remember that an honorable and an
awful duty is laid upon them. It is upon their fidelity,
so far as human agency is concerned, that the cause of
peace is suspended. Let them, then, be willing to avow
their opinions and to defend them. Neither let them
be contented with words, if more than words, if suffering
also, is required. It is only by the unyielding fidelity
of virtue that corruption can be extirpated. If you believe
that Jesus Christ has prohibited slaughter, let not
the opinions or the commands of a world induce you to
join in it. By this 'steady and determinate pursuit of
virtue,' the benediction which attaches to those who hear
the sayings of God, and do them, will rest upon you,
and the time will come when even the world will honor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
you as contributors to the work of human reformation."</p>

<p>Musser's work, entitled "Non-resistance Asserted;
or, Kingdom of Christ and Kingdom of this World
Separated," was published in 1864.</p>

<p>This book deals with the same question, drawing its
illustrations from the drafting of the United States citizens
during the time of the Civil War. In setting forth
the reasons why men should have the right to decline
military service, his arguments are no less applicable to
the present time. In his Introduction the author says:
"It is well known that there are great numbers of
people in the United States who profess to be conscientiously
opposed to war. They are mostly called
non-resistants, or defenseless Christians, and refuse to
defend their country, or take up arms at the call of the
government and go forth to battle against its enemies.
Hitherto this conscientious scruple has been respected
by the government in this country; and those claiming
it have been relieved or excused from this service.</p>

<p>"Since the commencement of the present civil war in
the United States the public mind has been unusually
agitated on this subject. It is not unreasonable that
such persons as feel it to be their duty to go forth and
endure the hardships of camp life, and imperil health,
life, and limb in defense of their country and government,
should feel some jealousy of those who have, with
themselves, long enjoyed the protection and benefits of
the government, and yet, in the hour of its need, refuse
to share the burden of its defense and protection.
Neither is it strange that such a position should be
looked upon as most unreasonable and monstrous, and
those who hold it be regarded with some suspicion.
"Many able speakers and writers," says the author,
"have raised their voices and pens to refute the idea of
non-resistance, as both unreasonable and unscriptural.
This is not to be wondered at, seeing that those who
profess the principle and do not possess it, or correctly
understand it, act inconsistently, and thereby bring the
profession into disrepute and contempt. However much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
misapplication or abuse of a principle may prejudice
the minds of those who are unacquainted with a subject,
it is yet no argument against its truth."</p>

<p>The author at first proves it to be the duty of each
Christian to obey the rule of non-resistance. He says
that the rule is perfectly explicit, and that it has been
given by Christ to all Christianity without any possibility
of being misinterpreted. "Judge for yourselves,
whether it is right or wrong to obey man more than you
do the Lord," said both Peter and John; and in exactly
the same way every man who wishes to be a Christian
should regard the requirement of his nation to be a
soldier, remembering that Christ has told him, "Do not
resist evil."</p>

<p>This, in the opinion of Musser, decides the question
of principle. Another point, as to the right of declining
military duty while one enjoys the advantages accruing
through violence, the author considers in detail, and
arrives at the conclusion that should a Christian who
follows the teaching of Christ refuse to go to the war,
he must also decline to take any position under the government
or any part in the elections, neither must he
have recourse to any officer of the law for his own personal
advantage. Our author goes on to consider the
relation between the Old and New Testaments, and
the significance of government for non-Christians;
arguments against the doctrine of non-resistance are
enumerated and refuted. The author closes his book
with the following words:&mdash;"Christians need no governments:
for they ought not to obey it in those matters
wherein Christ's teaching is set at naught, and
still less should they take an active part in it. Christ
has chosen His disciples out of the world. They have
no promise of temporal good or happiness, but the contrary.
Their promise is in the world to come. The
spirit which they possess renders them happy and contented
in any sphere of life. So long as the world tolerates
them, they are contented; but if it will not let
them dwell in peace, they flee to another city or place;
and so they are true pilgrims and strangers on earth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
having no certain abiding place.... They are well contented
that the dead may bury their dead, if they are
only permitted to follow Christ."</p>

<p>Without deciding upon the merits of this definition of
a Christian's duty in regard to war, which we find set
down in these two works, we cannot fail to see the
urgent need for a decision in regard to the question
itself.</p>

<p>There are men&mdash;hundreds of thousands of Quakers,
Mennonites, our own Duhobortzi, Molokani, men who
belong to no sect whatsoever&mdash;who believe that violence
and therefore military service is incompatible with Christianity;
every year, for instance, we see in Russia a
number of men refusing to obey the conscription because
of their religious opinions. And how does the
government deal with them? Does it release them?
Oh, no!... Does it use force, and in case of disobedience
punish them? Not exactly.... In 1818, government
managed the affair in this wise.</p>

<p>The following is an extract, hardly known to any one
in Russia, from a letter of Muraviev-Karsky, which was
prohibited by the Russian censor:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Tiflis</span>, <em>October 2d, 1818</em>.
</p>

<p>"This morning the commander of the fortress told me
that five peasants belonging to the landowners of the
government of Tambov had been recently sent into the
province of Grusia. These men were intended to serve
as soldiers, but they refused to obey. They were flogged
several times and made to run the gantlet, but they
were ready to give themselves up to the most cruel
tortures, yea, even to death itself, to escape military
service. 'Let us go our way and harm us not; we do
no harm ourselves. All men are equal. The sovereign
is a man like one of us, why should we pay him taxes,
and wherefore should we risk our lives to kill in battle
those who have never done us any harm? Draw and
quarter us, if you will, and we shall never change our
minds; we will never wear the uniform, nor mess at the
soldier's table. Some pitying soul may give us alms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
but from the government we neither have had nor will
have anything whatsoever.' Such are the words of
these peasants, who assure us that there are many men
in Russia like themselves. Four times they were brought
before the Committee of Ministers, and it was finally
decided that a report be made to the Czar, who ordered
them to be sent to Grusia for discipline, and desired the
Commander-in-Chief to forward a monthly report of the
progress made in bringing these peasants to a proper
frame of mind."</p></blockquote>

<p>The final result of this discipline is not known, for the
matter was kept a profound secret, and the episode may
never have been made public.</p>

<p>This was the conduct of the government seventy-five
years ago in the greater number of cases, always carefully
hiding the truth from the people; and it pursues
the same policy at the present day, except in regard to
the German Mennonites, who live in the government of
Kherson, and who in lieu of military duty serve a corresponding
term as foresters,&mdash;the justice of their refusal
to obey the conscription being recognized.</p>

<p>But they are the sole exception; all others who, from
religious scruples, refuse to perform military duty are
treated in the manner just described.</p>

<p>At first the government employs all the methods of
coercion now in use to discipline and <em>convert</em> the rebels,
while at the same time the most profound secrecy envelops
all these proceedings. I know of a process
which was begun in 1884 against a man who had declined
to serve,&mdash;a long-drawn-out trial which was
guarded by the Ministry as a great secret.</p>

<p>The first step is usually to send the accused to the
priests, and, be it said to their shame, they always try
to win over the insubordinate. But as the influence
exercised in the name of Christ is generally unsuccessful,
the delinquent is sent from the clergy to the gendarmes,
who, finding in him no political offense, send
him back; whereupon he is despatched to the scientists,
the doctors, and thence into the insane hospital. While
he is thus sent to and fro, the delinquent, deprived of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
his liberty like a condemned convict, is made to endure
every kind of indignity and suffering. Four such cases
have come to my knowledge. The doctors generally release
the man from the insane hospital, and then every
underhanded and crafty device is employed to delay the
accused, because his release might encourage others to
follow his example. He is not allowed to remain among
the soldiers lest they discover from him that conscription
is not, as they are taught to believe, in accordance
with the law of God, but opposed to it. The most satisfactory
arrangement for a government would be either
to execute the delinquent, or beat him with rods until
he died, as was done in former times. But it is awkward
to condemn a man to public execution because
he is true to the doctrine which we all profess to believe.
Nor is it possible to take no notice of a man
when he refuses to obey. So the government either
tortures the man in order to compel him to deny Christ,
or tries to rid itself of him by some means which will
hide both the man and the crime from the eyes of the
world, rather than resort to public execution. All sorts
of cunning man&oelig;uvers and tricks are employed to torment
the man. He is either banished to some remote
province, or exasperated to disobedience and then imprisoned,
or sent to the reform battalion, where he may
be subjected to torture without publicity or restriction;
or he is pronounced insane and locked up in the insane
asylum. For instance, one was exiled to Tashkent; that
is to say, a pretense was made of transferring him thither.
Another was sent to Omsk, a third was court-martialed
for disobedience and imprisoned, and a fourth was put
into a house for the insane. The same thing is repeated
on every side. Not only the government, but the majority
of liberal free-thinkers, as though by preconcerted
agreement, carefully avoid alluding to what has been
said, written, or done in this matter of denouncing
the inconsistency of violence, as embodied in its most
shocking, crude, and striking form, in the person of
a soldier,&mdash;this readiness to commit murder,&mdash;not
only with the precepts of Christianity, but with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
dictates of mere humanity, which the world professes
to obey.</p>

<p>Hence all the information that I have gathered concerning
what has been accomplished, and what is still
going on in this work of explaining the doctrine of
Christ and the light in which it is regarded by the
ruling powers of Europe and America, has confirmed
me in the conviction that a spirit inimical to true Christianity
dwells in these authorities, exhibited chiefly by
the conspiracy of silence with which they enshroud any
manifestation of it.</p>

<p>All the criticisms of the statements contained in
my own book have given me a similar impression of a
wish to ignore the subject.</p>

<p>As I had anticipated, no sooner was the book published
than it was prohibited, and should, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
law, have been burned. But instead of being consumed
by the flames, every copy was taken by the government
officials and circulated in large numbers, both in manuscript
and in the lithographed sheets, as well as in translations
which were published abroad. It was not long
before criticisms began to appear, not only from the
clergy, but from the secular world, which the government,
so far from forbidding, took pains to encourage.
Hence the very refutation of the book, the existence of
which they assumed to be unknown, was made the
theme of theological controversy.</p>

<p>These criticisms, both foreign and domestic, may be
divided into two classes, religious and secular; the former
by persons who consider themselves believers, and
the latter by free-thinkers. I shall begin by considering
the former. In my book I accuse the clergy of inculcating
doctrines contrary to the commandments of
Christ, plainly and clearly expressed in the Sermon on
the Mount, and particularly in regard to the commandment
of non-resistance to evil, thereby depriving the
doctrine of Christ of all its significance. Do the ministers
of the gospel believe the Sermon on the Mount, including
the commandment of non-resistance, to be of divine
origin? Having felt themselves obliged to review my
book, it would seem as if they must first of all answer
the principal charge, and declare at once whether they
do or do not consider the Sermon on the Mount and
the commandment of non-resistance obligatory upon a
Christian. Instead of making the usual reply, couched
in words such as, "Though one cannot deny, neither can
one affirm, the more so as," etc., let them give a categorical
answer to my question: Did Christ practically
require his disciples to do that which he taught in the
Sermon on the Mount, and therefore may a Christian
appeal to a legal tribunal, either for defense or prosecution,
and still remain a Christian? May he consistently
take a part in a government which is the instrument of
violence? And that most important question, which,
since the introduction of the general conscription, concerns
us all: May a Christian remain a Christian and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
still disobey the direct command of Christ; may he
promise to conduct himself in a manner directly opposed
to the doctrine of Christ, by entering into military service
and putting himself in training to be a murderer?</p>

<p>The questions are put plainly and directly, and would
seem to call for plain and direct answers. But no; my
book has been received just as all previous denunciations
have been, those denunciations of the clergy who have
deviated from the law of Christ, with which history
abounds since the time of Constantine the Great. Many
words have been expended in noting the errors of my
interpretation of this or that passage of the Scriptures, of
how wrong I am in referring to the Trinity, the Redemption,
and the Immortality of the soul, but never a word of
that vital question: How are we to reconcile those lessons
of forgiveness, humility, patience, and love toward
all mankind, our neighbors as well as our enemies,
taught us by the Teacher, which dwell in the heart of
each of us, with the necessities caused by military aggressions
against our own countrymen as well as against
foreigners? All that deserves the name of a response
to these questions may be summed up under five headings.
I have endeavored to bring together in this book
not only the criticisms upon my book, but everything
that has ever been written on this subject.</p>

<p>The first criticisms with which I deal come mostly
from men of high position, either in Church or State,
who feel quite sure that no one will venture to combat
their assertions; should any one make the attempt, they
would never hear the arguments. These men, intoxicated
for the most part by their authority, have forgotten
that there is a Christianity in whose name they
hold their places. They condemn as sectarian all that
which is truly Christ-like in Christianity, while on the
other hand, every text in both Old and New Testaments
which can be wrested from its meaning so as to justify
an anti-Christian or pagan sentiment&mdash;upon these they
establish the foundation of Christianity. In order to
confirm their statement that Christianity is not opposed
to violence, these men generally quote, with the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
assurance, equivocal passages from the Old and New
Testaments, interpreting them in the most anti-Christian
spirit&mdash;the death of Ananias and Sapphira, the execution
of Simon the Sorcerer, etc. All of Christ's words
that can possibly be misinterpreted are quoted in vindication
of cruelty&mdash;the expulsion from the Temple, the
words "... it shall be more tolerable in that day for
Sodom than for that city" (Luke x. 12), and other passages.
According to these men, a Christian is not at all
obliged to be guided by the spirit of humility, forgiveness,
and love of his enemies. It is useless to try to
refute such a doctrine, because men who affirm it refute
themselves, or rather they turn away from Christ Himself,
to invent an ideal and a form of religion all their
own, forgetful of Him in whose name both the Church
and the offices they hold exist. If men but knew that
the Church preaches an unforgiving, murder-loving, and
belligerent Christ, they would not believe in that Church,
and its doctrines would be defended by none.</p>

<p>The second method, somewhat more awkward, consists
in affirming that though Christ did, in point of fact, teach
us to turn the other cheek, and to share our cloak, and
that these are indeed lofty moral laws, still ... the
world abounds in evil-doers, and if these wretches are
not subdued by force, the righteous will perish and the
world will be destroyed. I met with this argument for
the first time in St. John Chrysostom, and have called
attention to its unfairness in my book entitled "My
Religion."</p>

<p>This argument is groundless, because if we allow ourselves
to look upon our fellow-men as evil-doers, outcasts
(Raka), we sap the very foundations of the Christian
doctrine, which teaches us that we, the children of the
Heavenly Father, are brothers, and equal one to the
other. In the second place, if the same Father had
permitted us to use violence toward wrong-doers, as
there is no infallible rule for distinguishing the good
from the evil, every individual or every community
might class its neighbors under the head of evil-doers,
which is practically the case at the present time. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the third place, if it were possible to distinguish the
righteous from the unrighteous, even then it would not
be expedient in a Christian community to put to death,
to cripple, or to imprison the evil-doers, as in such a
community there would be no one to execute these
sentences, since every man in his quality of Christian
is forbidden to do violence to a malefactor.</p>

<p>The third mode of reply, more ingenious than the
preceding ones, consists in affirming that while to obey
the commandment of non-resistance is every Christian's
duty, when the injury is a personal one, it ceases to be
obligatory when harm is done to one's neighbor, and
that in such an emergency a Christian is bound to break
the commandment and use force against the evil-doer.
This assertion is purely arbitrary, and one finds no justification
for it throughout the whole body of the doctrine
of Christ.</p>

<p>Such an interpretation is not only a narrow one, but
actually amounts to a direct negation. If every man
has the right to employ violence whenever his neighbor
is threatened with danger, then the question becomes
reduced to this: How may one define what is called
danger to one's neighbor? If, however, my private
judgment is to be arbiter in this matter, then any violence
which I might commit on any occasion whatever
could be excused by the declaration that my neighbor
was in danger. Magicians have been burned, aristocrats
and Girondists put to death, because the men in power
considered them dangerous.</p>

<p>If this important condition, which destroys the significance
of the commandment, ever entered into the
thought of Christ, it would have been formulated somewhere.
Not only is no such exception to the commandment
to be found throughout the Teacher's life and
lessons, but there is on the other hand a warning
against an interpretation so false and misleading.</p>

<p>The error and the impracticability of such a definition
is vividly illustrated in the Bible story of Caiaphas, who
made use of this very same interpretation. He admitted
that it was not well to put to death the innocent Jesus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
but at the same time he perceived the existence of a
danger, not for himself, but for all the people, and therefore
declared it better for one man to die, rather than
that a whole nation should perish.</p>

<p>And we have a still more explicit proof of the fallacy
of this interpretation in the words addressed to Peter,
when he tried to revenge by violence the attack upon
Jesus (Matthew xxvi. 51). Peter was defending not himself,
but his beloved and divine Master, and Christ distinctly
forbade him, saying, "For all they that take the
sword shall perish with the sword" (Matthew xxvi. 52).
One can never justify an act of violence against one's
fellow-man by claiming to have done it in defense of
another who was enduring some wrong, because in
committing an act of violence, it is impossible to compare
the one wrong with the other, and to say which
is the greater, that which one is about to commit, or the
wrong done against one's neighbor. We release society
from the presence of a criminal by putting him to death,
but we cannot possibly know that the former might not
have so changed by the morrow as to render the execution
a useless cruelty. We imprison another, we believe
him a dangerous man; but no later than next day this
very man may have ceased to be dangerous, and his
imprisonment has become unnecessary. I see a robber,
a man known to me, pursuing a girl; I hold a gun in
my hand; I wound or perhaps kill the robber, and save
the girl. The fact that I have either wounded or killed
the robber remains, but I know not what might have
happened had I not done so. And what a vast amount
of harm must and does accrue from the assurance that
a man feels of his right to provide against a possible
calamity. Ninety-nine parts of the world's iniquity,
from the Inquisition to the bomb-throwing of the present
day, and the execution of tens of thousands of
political criminals, so called, result from this very
assurance.</p>

<p>The fourth and still more ingenious reply to this
question of the Christian's responsibility in regard to
the commandment of Christ concerning non-resistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to evil by violence, consists in asserting that this commandment
is not denied, but acknowledged, like all the
others; it is only the special significance attributed to
it by sectarians that is denied. Our critics declare that
the views of Garrison, Ballou, and Dymond, as well as
those professed by the Quakers, the Shakers, the Mennonites,
the Moravians, the Waldenses, Albigenses,
Bogomiles, and Paulicians, are those of bigoted sectarians.
This commandment, they say, has the importance,
no more and no less, of all the others; and one
who through weakness has transgressed against any of
the commandments, whether that of non-resistance or
another, does not for that cause cease to be a Christian,
provided his creed be true.</p>

<p>This is a very cunning and persuasive subterfuge,
especially for those who are willing to be deceived, reducing
the direct negation of the commandment to its
accidental infraction. One has, however, but to compare
the attitude of the clergy toward this or any of the
other commandments which they do acknowledge, to be
convinced that it is quite different from their attitude
toward this one.</p>

<p>The commandment against fornication they acknowledge
without reservation, and in no case will they ever
admit that this sin is not an evil. There are no circumstances
mentioned by the clergy when the commandment
against fornication may be broken, and they
always insist that the occasions for this sin must be
avoided. But in regard to non-resistance it is a very
different matter. Every clergyman believes that there
are circumstances wherein this commandment may be
held in abeyance, and they preach accordingly. So far
from teaching their parishioners to avoid the temptations
to this sin, chief among which is the oath of allegiance,
they take the oath themselves. Clergymen have
never been known to advocate the breaking of any other
commandment; but in regard to the doctrine of non-resistance,
they distinctly teach that this prohibition
must not be taken too literally, that so far from always
obeying this commandment, one should on occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
follow the opposite course&mdash;that is, one should sit in
judgment, should go to war, and should execute criminals.
Thus in most of the cases where non-resistance
to evil by violence is in question, the preachers will be
found to advocate disobedience. Obedience to this
commandment, they say, is difficult, and can only be
practicable in a state of society whose members are
perfect. But how is it to become less difficult, when its
infraction is not only condoned, but directly encouraged,
when legal tribunals, prisons, the implements of warfare,
the cannon and muskets, armies and battles, receive
the blessing of the Church? Therefore this reply
is not true. Evidently the statement that this commandment
is acknowledged by the clergy to be of equal
validity with the other commandments cannot be true.</p>

<p>Clergymen do not really acknowledge it, yet, unwilling
to admit this fact, they try by evasion to conceal
their non-acknowledgment.</p>

<p>Such is the fourth method of answering.</p>

<p>The fifth, more ingenious than its predecessor, is the
popular one of all. It consists in quietly evading reply,
pretending that the question was solved ages ago, in a
cogent and satisfactory manner, and that it would be a
waste of words to reopen the subject. This method is
employed by all the more cultured authors, who, if they
made answer at all, would feel themselves bound to be
logical. Realizing that the inconsistency between that
doctrine of Christ, of which we make a verbal profession,
and the scheme of our daily lives, is not to be
solved by words, and that the more it is talked the more
glaring this inconsistency becomes, they evade it with
more or less circumspection, pretending that the question
of union between Christianity and the law of violence
has either been already solved, or else that it
cannot be solved at all.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>
<p>Most of my clerical critics have made use of this
method. I might quote scores of criticisms of this
class, wherein everything is discussed except the vital
principle of the book. As a characteristic specimen
of these criticisms I will quote from an article by that
well-known and scholarly Englishman, the writer and
preacher, Canon Farrar, who, like so many other learned
theologians, is an expert in the art of silently ignoring
and evading a statement. The article appeared in an
American magazine, <cite>The Forum</cite>, for October, 1888.</p>

<p>After briefly but conscientiously setting forth the subject-matter
of my book, Farrar says:&mdash;"After repeated
search the central principle of all Christ's teaching seemed
to him [Tolstoï] to be, 'Resist not evil' or 'him that is
evil.' He came to the conclusion that a coarse deceit
had been palmed upon the world when these words were
held by civil society to be compatible with war, courts
of justice, capital punishment, divorce, oaths, national
prejudice, and indeed with most of the institutions of
civil and social life. He now believes that the Kingdom
of God would come if all men kept these five commandments,
which he holds to be the pith of all Christ's
teaching&mdash;viz.: 1. Live in peace with all men. 2. Be
pure. 3. Take no oaths. 4. Never resist evil. 5. Renounce
national distinctions.... Most of the Bible does
not seem to him to reflect the spirit of Christ at all,
though it has been brought into artificial and unwarrantable
connection with it. Hence he rejects the chief doctrines
of the Church: that of the Atonement by blood,
that of the Trinity, that of the descent of the Holy Ghost
upon the Apostles and the transmission to the priesthood
by laying on of hands, that of the need of the seven sacraments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
for salvation. He sets aside the authority of
Paul, of councils, of fathers, popes, or patriarchs, and
believes himself to be the immediate disciple of Christ
alone.... But we are compelled to ask, Is this interpretation
of Christ a true one? Are all men bound, or is any
man bound, to act as this great writer has done?"</p>

<p>One might naturally expect that this vital question,
which alone could induce a man to write a dissertation
on the book, would be answered either by admitting that
my interpretation of the doctrine of Christ is correct and
should be accepted, or declaring that it is erroneous, proving
his point, and offering a more correct interpretation
of the words which I have misconstrued. But no; Farrar
merely expresses his belief that "though actuated by the
noblest sincerity, Count Tolstoï has been misled by partial
and one-sided interpretations of the meaning of the
gospel and the mind and will of Christ." In what this
error consists he does not explain, but says: "<em>To enter
into the proof of this is impossible in this article, for I
have already exceeded the space at my command</em>." And
concludes with equanimity: "Meanwhile the reader who
feels troubled lest it should be his duty also to forsake
all the conditions of his life, and to take up the position
and work of a common laborer, may rest for the present
on the principle, 'Securus judicat orbis terrarum.'
With few and rare exceptions the whole of Christendom,
from the days of the Apostles down to our own, has come
to the firm conclusion that it was the object of Christ to
lay down great eternal principles, but not to disturb the
bases and revolutionize the institutions as well as all inevitable
conditions. Were it my object to prove how
untenable is the doctrine of communism, based by Count
Tolstoï upon the divine paradoxes, which can be interpreted
on only historical principles in accordance with
the whole method of the teaching of Jesus, it would
require an ampler canvas than I have here at my
disposal." What a pity that he has no space! And,
wonderful to relate, no one for fifteen centuries ever
had the space to prove that the Christ whom we profess
said one thing and meant another. And of course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
they could prove it if they would! But it is not worth
while to prove what everybody knows to be true. It is
enough to say: "Securus judicat orbis terrarum."</p>

<p>The criticisms of all educated believers are very much
alike, because realizing as they must the danger of their
position, they feel that their only safeguard lies in the
hope that by sheltering themselves behind the authority
and holiness of the Church, they may succeed in intimidating
their readers, or diverting them from any idea of
reading the Bible for themselves or using their own reason
to solve this question. And this is a method that
succeeds. To whom would it ever occur, indeed, that
all these assurances, repeated with so much solemnity,
century after century, by archdeacons, bishops, and archbishops,
synods and popes, are a base falsehood, a calumny
against the character of Christ, uttered for the
purpose of assuring to themselves the money they require
to lead a life of ease at the expense of others,&mdash;a
falsehood and a calumny so palpable, particularly now,
that the only chance of perpetuating this falsehood lies
in holding the people in awe by their arrogance and
audacity?</p>

<p>The very same thing has been going on of late years
in the Bureau of military conscription. A number of
aged officials, decorated and self-important, are at a table,
a full-lengthed portrait of the Emperor with the mirror
of justice before them, and, while leisurely chatting with
each other, they write, call out the names, and give their
orders. Here also, with a cross upon his breast, his hair
blowing over his stole, a genial and venerable-looking
priest dressed in a silk robe sits before a pulpit on which
is placed a golden cross and a Bible with gilt clasps.</p>

<p>Ivan Petrov is called. An untidy, poorly clad youth,
with a frightened expression, twitching muscles, and
gleaming eyes that have a wandering look, steps forward,
and in a hesitating, broken voice almost whispers:
"I ... according to law ... as a Christian ... I ... I cannot...."
"What is he muttering?" asks the chairman,
impatiently, squinting and making an effort to hear, as
he raises his head from the book. "Speak louder!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
exclaims the colonel with the glittering shoulder-straps.
"As a Christian ... I ... I...." And at last it becomes
plain that the youth refuses to enter the military service
because he is a Christian. "Don't talk nonsense! Measure
him! Doctor, be kind enough to look at the measure.
Will he do?" "He will do." "Holy Father, let him
take the oath."</p>

<p>Not only is there no uneasiness on the part of the
officers, but no one pays the least attention to the muttering
of this frightened, pitiable youth. "They always
mutter, and we are in a hurry; we have still so many
more to receive."</p>

<p>The recruit tries to speak again. "This is against
the law of Christ!" "Move on! move on! We know
what is lawful and what is not! Move on! Father,
make him understand! Next! Vassili Nikitin!"</p>

<p>Then the trembling youth is led away. Now which of
all these men, the soldiers, Vassili Nikitin, the new man
on the list, or any other witness of the scene,&mdash;which
of these would ever dream that the unintelligible, broken
utterances of the youth, silenced forthwith by the magistrates,
embodied the real truth, while the loud, arrogant
speeches of the officials, of the priest, uttered with authority,
were actually false?</p>

<p>The same impression is made not only by Farrar's
essay, but by all those grandiloquent sermons, reviews,
and other publications which spring into existence on
every side wherever truth is found combating the arrogance
of falsehood. At once these orators and writers,
subtle or bombastic, begin by dwelling upon points closely
allied to the vital question, while preserving an artful
silence on the question itself.</p>

<p>And this is the fifth and most efficacious method of
accounting for the inconsistent attitude of ecclesiastical
Christianity, which, while professing Christ, with its own
life denies, and teaches others to deny, this doctrine in
the practice of daily life. They who employ the first
method of justification by boldly and distinctly affirming
that Christ sanctioned violence, meaning wars and murders,
put themselves beyond the pale of Christ's teaching;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
while they who defend themselves according to the
second, third, and fourth methods soon become entangled,
and are easily convicted of falsehood; but the fifth class,
they who condescend not to reason, use their dignity for
a screen, and insist that all these questions were settled
ages ago, and need no reconsideration; they, apparently
invulnerable, will maintain an undisputed authority, and
men will repose under the hypnotic suggestion of Church
and State, nor seek to throw off the yoke.</p>

<p>Such were the views of the clergy, of the professors
of Christianity, in regard to my book, nor could anything
different have been expected: they are in bonds to their
inconsistent position, believers in the divinity of the
Teacher, and yet discrediting His plainest words,&mdash;an
inconsistency which they are bound to reconcile in some
way. Hence it is not to be supposed that they would
give unbiased opinions in regard to the essential question
of that change which must take place in the life of
one who makes a practical application of the doctrine of
Christ to the existing order. From secular critics and
free-thinkers, who acknowledge no obligation to the doctrine
of Christ, and who might be expected to judge them
without prejudice, I had prepared myself for criticisms
such as these. I thought that the Liberals would look
upon Christ not only as the founder of a religion involving
personal salvation (as understood by the ecclesiastics
and their followers), but, to use their own expression, as
upon a reformer who tears down the old foundations to
make way for new ones, and whose reformation is not
even yet complete.</p>

<p>To set forth that conception of Christ and his doctrine
has been the object of my book. But to my surprise not
one out of the many criticisms, Russian or foreign, that
have appeared, has accepted my view, or even discussed
it from my standpoint, which is, that the teaching of Christ
is a philosophical, moral, and social doctrine. (I use
the phraseology of the scientists.) The Russian secular
critics, conceiving the sum and substance of my book to
be a plea in favor of resistance to evil, and taking it for
granted (probably for the sake of argument) that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
doctrine forbade any struggle whatsoever against the
wrong, made a virulent, and for several years, most successful
attack upon this doctrine, proving that the teaching
of Christ must be false, since it forbids any effort to
overcome evil. Their refutations of this so-called <em>false</em>
doctrine had all the more chance of success, because the
censorship had prohibited, not only the book itself, but
also all articles in its defense, and consequently they knew
beforehand that their arguments could not be assailed.</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that here in Russia, where not a
word against the Holy Scriptures is allowed by the censor,
for several years in succession the distinct and unmistakable
commandment of Christ (Matthew v. 39) was
criticized, distorted, condemned, and mocked at in all
the leading periodicals.</p>

<p>The Russian secular critics, apparently ignorant of
all that had been said and done in regard to non-resistance
to evil, seemed to think that I had invented
the principle myself, and attacked it as if it were my
idea, first distorting and then refuting it with great
ardor, bringing forward time-worn arguments that had
been analyzed and refuted over and over again, showing
that the oppressed and downtrodden should be
defended by violence, and declaring the doctrine of
Christ concerning non-resistance to be immoral.</p>

<p>All the significance that the Russian critics saw in
Christ's preaching was, that it seemed expressly intended
to hamper them in their struggles against what
they believe to be an evil in the present day. Thus it
came about that the principle of non-resistance to evil
by violence was attacked from two opposite camps;
the Conservatives, because this principle interfered
with them in their efforts to suppress sedition, and as
opposed to all persecution, as well as to the punishment
of death; the Revolutionists, because this principle forbade
them to resist the oppression of the Conservatives,
or to attempt their overthrow. The Conservatives were
indignant that the doctrine of non-resistance to evil by
violence should thwart an energetic suppression of revolutionary
elements, which might imperil the welfare of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
a nation; the Revolutionists in the like manner were indignant
because this same doctrine averted the downfall
of the Conservatives, who, in their opinion, imperil the
welfare of the people. It is a circumstance worthy of
notice that the Revolutionists should attack the principle
of non-resistance to evil by violence; for of all the
doctrines dreaded by despotism, and dangerous to its
existence, this is the chief one. Since the creation of
the world the opposite principle of resistance by violence
has been the corner-stone of every despotic institution,
from the Inquisition to the fortress of Schlüsselburg.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Russian critics declared that the progress
of civilization itself would be checked were this
commandment of non-resistance applied to everyday
life, by which they mean the civilization of Europe,
which is, according to them, the model for all mankind.</p>

<p>Such was the substance of Russian criticism.</p>

<p>Foreign critics start from the same premises, but their
deductions differ somewhat from those of the Russian
critics; not only are they less captious and more cultivated,
but their modes of analysis are not the same.</p>

<p>In discussing my book, and more particularly the gospel
doctrine as it is expressed in the Sermon on the
Mount, the foreign critics affirmed that the latter could
not really be called Christian doctrine (they believe
that the Christian doctrine is embodied in Catholicism
or Protestantism), and that the precepts of the Sermon
on the Mount are only a series of the delightful
but unpractical visions of the "charmant docteur," as
Renan says, suited to the artless, half-civilized Galileans
who lived 1800 years ago, or to the Russian and semi-barbarous
peasants, to Sutaev and Bondarev, and to the
Russian mystic Tolstoï, but which are by no means
adapted to the lofty plane of European culture. The
foreign secular critics, in a courteous way, in order not
to wound my feelings, have endeavored to show that my
belief that mankind may be guided by so simple a doctrine
as the Sermon on the Mount arises partly from
my limited knowledge of history and ignorance of the
many vain attempts to carry out in daily life the principles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
of the Sermon on the Mount, which history tells us
have always proved an utter failure, and partly from my
misconception of the significance of our modern civilization,
with its Krupp guns, its smokeless powder, its
African colonization, its Home Rule, its parliaments,
journalism, strikes, and constitutions, not to mention
the Eiffel Tower,&mdash;on which the entire population of
Europe is at present reposing.</p>

<p>Thus wrote Vogüé, thus wrote Leroy-Beaulieu, Matthew
Arnold, the American writer Talmage, who is also
a popular preacher, the free-thinker Ingersoll, and others.</p>

<p>"The teaching of Christ is no longer practicable, because
it does not suit our industrial times," Ingersoll
ingenuously remarks, and thereby he no doubt gives
utterance to the views which this cultured generation
holds in regard to the doctrine of Christ. The doctrine
has no affinity with the industrialism of the present age,
as though industrialism were a sacred institution which
can suffer no change. A drunkard might thus reply
to one who calls upon him to be sober, that a man in
liquor finds such advice absurd.</p>

<p>The arguments of all secular writers, Russian as well
as foreign, however varied in form or expression, are
substantially alike; they all agree in misapprehending
the doctrine of Christ, with its outcome of non-resistance,
and in affirming that it is not expedient because it implies
a need of a change of life.</p>

<p>The doctrine of life is inexpedient, because if we lived
up to it our lives could not go on as they have done
hitherto; in other words, if we were to begin to live
like righteous men, as Christ bids us, we must abandon
the wicked ways to which we have grown accustomed.
So far from discussing the question of non-resistance of
evil by violence, the very mention of the fact that the
precepts of Christ include such a command is considered
as sufficient proof of the inexpediency of the whole
doctrine.</p>

<p>And yet it would seem necessary to offer some solution
of this question, as it lies at the root of all that most
interests us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>The question is how to settle these differences among
men, when the very action that is considered evil by
one man is considered good by another. It is no
answer to say that I think an action evil although my
adversary may consider it a good one. There are but
two ways of solving the difficulty. One is to find a
positive and indisputable standard of evil, and the other
is to obey the command, resist not evil by violence.</p>

<p>Men have tried to achieve the former from the earliest
historical ages, and we all know with what unsuccessful
results.</p>

<p>The second solution&mdash;that is, the non-resistance of
what we must consider evil until we have found a universal
standard: that solution has been suggested by
Christ himself.</p>

<p>It might be thought that the solution suggested by
Christ was the wrong one, and a better one might be
substituted after the standard had been found which is
to define evil once and for all. One might not know of
the existence of such a question, as is the case with the
barbarous races, but no one can be permitted to pretend,
like the learned critics of the Christian doctrine,
that no such question does exist, or that the recognition
of the right of certain individuals or groups of individuals,
and still less of one's own right, to define evil, and to resist
it by violence, decides the question, because we all
know that such a recognition does not decide it at all,
for there are always persons who will refuse to admit
that such a prerogative can exist.</p>

<p>And yet this very acknowledgment, that anything that
seems evil to us is evil, or else an utter misconception of
the question, affords a basis for the conclusions of secular
critics concerning the doctrine of Christ; hence not
only the utterances of the clerical, but also those of the
secular critics in regard to my book, have made it evident
to me that most men totally fail to comprehend
either the doctrine of Christ, or the questions which it
is intended to decide.</p>

<h3>MISCONCEPTION OF CHRISTIANITY BY NON-BELIEVERS</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The meaning of the Christian doctrine, which is clear for the minority, has

therefore Churches use all their efforts to defend it.</p></blockquote>


<p>The knowledge which I obtained after the publication
of my book in regard to the views which the minority
of mankind have held, and still hold, concerning
the doctrine of Christ in its simplicity and real significance,
as well as the criticisms of clerical and secular
writers, who deny the possibility of apprehending it in
its actual meaning, have convinced me that while the
minority has not only always possessed a true conception
of this doctrine, and that this conception has grown
steadily more and more clear, for the majority, on the other
hand, its sense has become more and more vague, reaching
at last such a degree of obscurity that men fail to understand
the simplest commands expressed in the Bible,
even when couched in the plainest possible language.</p>

<p>The inability that prevails at the present time to comprehend
the doctrine of Christ in its true, simple, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
actual meaning, when its light has penetrated into the
remotest recesses of the human understanding, when,
as Christ said, they proclaim from the roofs that which
He whispered in the ear; when this doctrine penetrates
every phase of human life, domestic, economical, civil,
politic, and international,&mdash;this failure to apprehend it
would be inexplicable, if one had not discovered the
reasons for it.</p>

<p>One of the reasons is, that believers as well as unbelievers
are perfectly sure that they long ago understood
the doctrine of Christ so completely, unquestionably,
and finally, that it can have no other meaning but the
one which they attribute to it. That is because the
tradition of this false conception has been handed down
for ages,&mdash;and therefore its misconception.</p>

<p>The most powerful stream of water cannot add one
single drop to a vessel that is already full.</p>

<p>One might succeed in explaining to the dullest of men
the most difficult of problems, if he had no previous conception
in regard to them; but it is impossible to explain
to the cleverest man even the simplest matters, if he is
perfectly sure that he knows everything about it.</p>

<p>The Christian doctrine appears to men of the present
times to be a doctrine of that kind, known for ages, and
never to be questioned in its most trivial details, and
which is susceptible of no other interpretation.</p>

<p>At the present time Christianity is conceived by those
who profess the doctrines of the Church as a supernatural,
miraculous revelation of all that is expressed
in the Credo; while unbelievers look upon it as an
affair of the past, a manifestation of the demand of
humanity for a belief in the supernatural, as an historical
fact, which has found its fullest expression in
Catholicism, Orthodoxy, and Protestantism, and which
has for us no vital meaning. For the believers the real
significance of the doctrine is concealed by the Church;
for the unbelievers it is hidden by science.</p>

<p>Let us begin by considering the former.</p>

<p>Eighteen hundred years ago, in the pagan world of
Rome, there appeared a strange and novel doctrine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
unlike any of its predecessors, which was ascribed to
the man Christ.</p>

<p>It was a doctrine wholly new in form as well as in
substance, both for the Hebrew world, from whose midst
it had sprung, as well as for the Roman world, in whose
midst it was preached and promulgated.</p>

<p>Among the accurately defined religious precepts of
the Jews, where, according to Isaiah, there was precept
upon precept, and among the highly perfected Roman
legislative assemblies, there appeared a doctrine that
not only repudiated all deities, all fear of them, all
augury and all faith in it, but also denied the necessity
for any human institutions whatsoever. Instead of the
precepts and creeds of former times, this doctrine presented
only an image of interior perfection, truth, and
love in the person of Christ, and the attainment of this
interior perfection possible for men, and, as a consequence,
of the outward perfection foretold by the
prophets: the coming of the Kingdom of God, when all
enmity shall cease, when every man will hear the word
of the Lord and be united with another in brotherly
love, and when the lion and the lamb shall lie down
together. Instead of threats of punishment for the non-observance
of the commandments of the old laws, religious
no less than secular, instead of tempting men by
promise of rewards to observe these laws, this doctrine attracted
mankind only by proclaiming itself to be the truth.</p>

<p>"If any man will do his will, he shall know of the
doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of
myself."&mdash;John vii. 17.</p>

<p>"Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say
the truth, why do ye not believe me?"&mdash;John viii. 46.</p>

<p>"But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told
you the truth...."&mdash;John viii. 40.</p>

<p>"And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall
make you free."&mdash;John viii. 32.</p>

<p>God must be worshiped in truth. All the doctrine
will be made plain by the Spirit of Truth. Do as I
command you, and you will know whether what I say
is the truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>No evidence was brought to prove the doctrine, except
the truth and its harmony therewith. The whole
substance consisted in learning the truth and in following
its guidance, drawing nearer and nearer to it in the
affairs of everyday life.</p>

<p>According to this doctrine, there is no mode of action
that can justify a man or make him righteous; as regards
interior perfection we have only the image of
truth, in the person of Christ, to win our hearts, and
outward perfection is expressed by a realization of the
Kingdom of God. In order to fulfil the doctrine it needs
but to take Christ for our model, and to advance in the
direction of interior perfection by the road which has
been pointed out to us, as well as in that of exterior
perfection, which is the establishment of the Kingdom
of God. The degree of human happiness, whether it be
more or less, depends, according to this doctrine, not
on the degree of perfection at which it arrives, but on
the comparative rate of progress toward that perfection.</p>

<p>The advance toward perfection of Zacchæus the
publican, of the adulteress, of the thief on the cross, is,
according to this doctrine, better than the stagnation of
the righteous Pharisee. The shepherd rejoices more
over the one sheep which was lost and is found than
over the ninety and nine which are in the fold. The
prodigal returned, the piece of money which was lost
and is found, is more precious unto God than that which
was never lost.</p>

<p>According to this doctrine, each state is but a step on
the road toward the unattainable interior and exterior
perfection, and therefore it has no significance in itself.
The progress of this movement toward perfection is
its merit; the least cessation of this movement means
the cessation of good works.</p>

<p>"Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand
doeth," and "No man, having put his hand to the
plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of
God." "Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto
you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
in heaven." "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your
Father which is in heaven is perfect." "Seek ye first
the kingdom of God and his righteousness."</p>

<p>The fulfilment of the doctrine lies in a continual progress
toward the attainment of a higher truth, and in
the growing realization of that truth within one's self,
by means of an ever increasing love; as well as in a
more and more keen realization of the Kingdom of God
in the world around us. It is evident that the doctrine
that appeared in the midst of the Hebrew and pagan
world could not be accepted by the majority of men,
who lived a life so totally unlike the one prescribed by
this new doctrine; and even those who did accept it
could not comprehend its full meaning, because of its
contradiction of all former ideas.</p>

<p>It is only through a series of misapprehensions, errors,
one-sided explanations, corrected and supplemented by
generations of men, that the meaning of the Christian
doctrine has become more and more plain. The Christian
world-conception and that of the Hebrew and pagan
peoples mutually acted and reacted upon each other,
and the Christian principle being the more vital, it penetrated
deeper and deeper into the Hebrew and pagan
principles that had outlived their usefulness, and became
more clearly defined, freeing itself from the spurious
admixtures imposed upon it. Men understood its
meaning better and better, and realized it more and
more unmistakably in life.</p>

<p>The older the world grew, the more lucid became its
apprehension of Christianity, as must always be the case
with any doctrine relating to human life.</p>

<p>Successive generations rectified the mistakes of the
preceding ones and approached nearer and nearer to
the apprehension of its true meaning. Thus it was
from the very beginning of Christianity. And it was
then that certain men came to the front who affirmed
that the only true interpretation was the one which they
themselves proclaimed, adducing the miracles as a proof
thereof.</p>

<p>This was the principal cause of its misapprehension<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
in the first place, and of its complete perversion in the
second.</p>

<p>The doctrine of Christ was supposed to be transmitted
to mankind not like any other truth, but in a peculiar,
supernatural manner; hence they propose to prove its
authority, not because it satisfies the demands of reason
and of human nature in general, but because of the
miraculous character of its transmission, which is supposed
to be an incontrovertible proof of the validity
of its conception. This idea sprang from a misconception,
and the result was that it became impossible to
understand it.</p>

<p>It originated at the very beginning, when the doctrine
was so imperfectly understood and often so erroneously
construed; as, for example, in the Gospels and the Acts.
The less men understood it, the more mysterious it
appeared, and the greater need was there for visible
proof of its authenticity. The rule for doing unto
others as you would wish them to do unto you, called
for no miraculous proof, neither did it require faith,
because the proposition is convincing in itself, both to
reason and to human nature. But the proposition that
Christ was God needed miraculous testimony.</p>

<p>The more mystical grew the apprehension of Christ's
teaching, the more the miraculous element entered into
it; and the more miraculous it became, the farther it
was from its original meaning; and the more complicated,
mystical, and remote from its original meaning
it came to be, the more necessary it was to declare its
infallibility, and the less intelligible it became.</p>

<p>From the very beginning of Christianity one could
see from the Gospels, the Acts, and the Epistles how
the misapprehension of the doctrine called forth the
necessity of proofs&mdash;miraculous and beyond human
intelligence.</p>

<p>It dated from the time mentioned in the Acts, when
the disciples went up to Jerusalem to consult with the
elders in regard to the question that had arisen as to
whether the uncircumcised and those who abstained not
from the meat offered to idols should be baptized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>The very manner of asking the question showed that
those who discussed it misconceived the doctrine of
Christ, who rejected all external rites, such as the washing
of the feet, purification, fasts, and the Sabbath. It
is said distinctly: "Not that which goeth into the mouth
defileth a man; but those things which proceed out of
the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile
the man." And therefore the question in regard to the
baptism of those not circumcised could only arise among
men who, loving their Teacher and with the intuitive
perception of the grandeur of his doctrine, could not as
yet comprehend its exact meaning. And so it was.</p>

<p>And in proportion as the members of the assembly
failed to comprehend the doctrine, did they stand in need
of an outward affirmation of their incomplete conception.
And in order to decide the question, whose very proposal
proves the misconception of the doctrine, it was that in
this assembly for the first time, according to the description
given in the Acts, were uttered those awful words,
productive of so much harm, by which the truth of certain
propositions has been for the first time confirmed:
"For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us;"
that is to say, it was a declaration that the truth of what
they said was witnessed by a miraculous participation of
the Holy Ghost, that is&mdash;of God.</p>

<p>But the assertion that the Holy Ghost&mdash;that is to
say, God&mdash;had spoken through the apostles, in its
turn required proof. And therefore it became necessary
to declare that on the fiftieth day the Holy Ghost, in the
shape of fiery tongues, descended on those who had
made this assertion. [In the description the descent of
the Holy Ghost precedes the council, but the Acts were
written much later than either.] But the descent of the
Holy Ghost must also be proved, though it would be
difficult to say why a fiery tongue hovering over a man's
head should be a proof of the truth of what he says any
more than the miracles, the cures, the resurrections, the
martyrdoms, and all the rest of those persuasive miracles
with which the Acts are filled, and which serve rather
to repel than to convince one of the truth of the Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
dogmas. The results of these methods were such
that the more pains they took to confirm their statements,
accumulating stories of miracles, the more the
doctrine itself deviated from its original meaning, and
the less intelligible it became.</p>

<p>Thus it was from the beginning of the Christian era,
and thus it continued to increase, until in its own time it
has reached its logical consummation in the dogma of
transubstantiation, the infallibility of the Pope, the bishops,
and Scriptures, which is something utterly incomprehensible
and nonsensical, requiring a blind faith, not
in God or Christ, nor even in the doctrine, but a faith
either in one person, as in Catholicism, or in many persons,
as in Orthodoxy, or in a book, as in Protestantism.
The more widely spread Christianity became, and the
larger the number of uninstructed men it received, the
less it was understood, the more the infallibility of its
conceptions was insisted upon, and the more slender
grew the possibility of understanding its true meaning.
Already, about the time of Constantine, the entire conception
of the doctrine amounted to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">résumé</i> formulated
by the temporal power,&mdash;the outcome of discussions
that took place in the council,&mdash;to the Credo, in
which it is said: I believe in this and that, etc., and at
the end, "in the one holy, Apostolic and &OElig;cumenical
Church," that is, in the infallibility of the persons who
constitute it; so that it all amounted to this, that a man
believed not in God, nor in Christ, as they revealed themselves
to him, but in that which was believed by the Church.</p>

<p>But the Church is holy, and was founded by Christ.
God could not allow men to interpret His doctrine as
they chose, and therefore He established the Church.
All these propositions are so unjust and unfounded, that
one is actually ashamed to refute them. In no place,
and in no manner whatsoever, save in the assertion of
the Church, is it seen that either God or Christ can ever
have founded anything like the Church in its ecclesiastical
sense. There is a distinct and evident warning in
the New Testament against the Church, as an outside
authority, in the passage which bids the disciples of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Christ call no man father or master. But nowhere is
there a word in regard to the establishment of what the
ecclesiastics call the Church. The word "church" is used
in the New Testament twice, once in speaking of the
assembly which is to decide a dispute; the second time
in connection with the obscure words in regard to the
rock, Peter, and the gates of hell. From these two
references, where the word is used only in the sense of
an assembly, men have derived the institution which we
recognize at present under the same of the Church.</p>

<p>But Christ could by no means have founded a church,
that is, what we understand by that word at the present
time, because nothing like our Church, as we know it in
these days, with the sacraments, the hierarchy, and
above all the establishment of infallibility, was to be
found either in the words of Christ, or in the ideas of
the men of those times.</p>

<p>Because men have called something which has been
established since, by the same word that Christ used in
regard to another thing, by no means gives them a right
to assert that Christ founded only one true Church.</p>

<p>Moreover, if Christ had it in his mind to establish
a church which was to be the depository of the whole
doctrine and faith, He would surely have expressed
this so plainly and clearly, and would have given, apart
from all stories of miracles which are repeated with
every variety of superstition, such signs as would leave
no doubt as to its authenticity; yet this was not the case,
and now, as always, one finds different institutions, each
one calling itself the only true Church.</p>

<p>The Catholic catechism says: "L'Eglise est la société
des fidèles établie par N.-S. Jésus-Christ, répandue sur
toute la terre et soumise à l'autorité de pasteurs légitimes,
principalement notre S.-P. le pape,"&mdash;meaning
by "pasteurs légitimes,"<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> a human institution made up
of a number of men bound together by a certain organization
of which the Pope is the head.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>
<p>The Orthodox catechism says: "Our Church is a
society established on earth by Jesus Christ, united by
the divine doctrine and the sacraments under the government
and direction of a hierarchy established by the
Lord,"&mdash;those words, "established by the Lord," signifying
a Greek hierarchy, composed of certain men who
are ordained to fill certain places.</p>

<p>The Lutheran catechism says: "Our Church is a holy
Christian society of believers under Christ, our Master,
in which the Holy Ghost, by means of the Bible and the
sacraments, offers, communicates, and dispenses the
divine salvation,"&mdash;meaning by that, that the Catholic
Church is in error, and has fallen away from grace,
and that the genuine tradition has been preserved in
Protestantism.</p>

<p>For Catholics the divine Church is identified with the
Pope and the Roman hierarchy. For the Orthodox it is
identified with the institution of the Eastern and Russian
hierarchy.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> For Lutherans the divine Church signifies
a congregation of men who acknowledge the Bible and
the Lutheran catechism.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>
<p>When those who belong to any one of the existing
churches speak of the beginnings of Christianity, they
generally use the word "church" in the singular, as
though there had never been but one church. This is
quite unfair. The Church, which as an institution
declares itself to be the depository of infallible truth,
did not arise until there were already two.</p>

<p>While the faithful still agreed among themselves, the
congregation was united, and there was no occasion for
calling itself a church. It was only when it separated
into two hostile parties that each party felt obliged to
assert its possession of the truth by claiming infallibility.</p>

<p>During the course of the controversies between the
two parties, while each one claimed infallibility for itself
and declared its opponent heretical, arose the idea of
the one church.</p>

<p>We know that there was a church in the year 51,
which granted the admission of the uncircumcised,
and we know it only because there was another, the
Jewish Church, which denied their right to membership.</p>

<p>If at the present time there is a Catholic Church which
asserts its infallibility, it is because there are other
churches, namely, the Greek Orthodox and the Lutheran,
each one asserting its own infallibility, and thus
disowning all other churches. Hence the idea of one
church is but the product of the imagination, containing
not a shadow of reality.</p>

<p>It is an historical fact that there have existed, and still
continue to exist, numerous bodies, each one of whom
maintains itself to be the true Church established by
Christ, declaring at the same time that all the others who
call themselves churches are heretical and schismatic.</p>

<p>The catechisms of those churches which possess the
greatest number of communicants, the Catholic, the
Orthodox, and the Lutheran, express this in the plainest
language.</p>

<p>The Catholic catechism says: "Quels sont ceux qui
sont hors de l'Eglise? Les infidèles, hérétiques, et<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
schismatiques."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> By schismatics it means the so-called
Orthodox, and by heretics the Lutherans; so that, according
to the Catholic catechism, the Church is composed
only of Catholics.</p>

<p>In the so-called Orthodox catechism it says: "The
name Church of Christ means only the Orthodox Church,
which has remained in perfect union with the universal
Church. As to the Roman Church and the Protestant
creeds" (they are not even called a church), "they cannot
belong to the one true Church, for they have separated
themselves from it."</p>

<p>According to this definition the Catholics and the
Protestants are outside of the Church, and only the
Orthodox are in it.</p>

<p>The Lutheran catechism says: "Die wahre Kirche
wird darein erkannt, das in ihr das Wort Gottes lauter
und rein ohne Menschenzusetzung gelehrt und die
Sacramenten treu nach Christ Einsetzung gewartet
werden."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>According to this definition, those who have added
anything whatsoever to the teaching of Christ and the
apostles, as the Catholic and Greek Churches have done,
are outside the Church, and the Lutherans alone are
in it.</p>

<p>The Catholics assert that the Holy Ghost dwells perpetually
with their hierarchy; the Orthodox assert that
the same Holy Ghost resides also with them; the Arians
claim that the Holy Ghost manifests itself to them (and
they have the same right to assert this as have the prevailing
religions of the present day); all the denominations
of Protestants&mdash;Lutherans, Reformed Presbyterians,
Methodists, Swedenborgians, and Mormons&mdash;assert
that the Holy Ghost manifests itself only with them.</p>

<p>If the Catholics assert that the Holy Ghost during the
separation of the Arian and Greek Churches withdrew
from the separating churches and remained in the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
true Church, then the Protestants of any denomination
whatsoever may assert with as much right that during
the separation of their Church from the Catholic, the
Holy Ghost left the Catholic Church and entered into
their own. And this is exactly what they do say. Every
church professes to derive its creed by an unbroken
tradition from Christ and the apostles. And certainly
every Christian creed derived from Christ must have
reached the present generation through tradition of some
sort. But this is no proof that any one of these traditions
embodies infallible truth, to the exclusion of all others.</p>

<p>Every branch proceeds from the root without interruption;
but the fact that each one comes from one root,
by no means proves it to be the only branch. And so it
is in regard to the churches. The proofs which each
church offers of its apostolic succession, and the miracles
which are to prove its authenticity, are the same in every
case; consequently there is but one exact definition of
what is called a church (not the imaginary church which
we may desire, but the actual church which has really
existed). The Church is a body of men which lays
claim to the exclusive possession of the truth. All
these various societies which were afterward transformed
by State authority into powerful organizations
have really been the chief obstacles to the diffusion
of true Christianity. It could not be otherwise: for the
principal characteristic which distinguishes the doctrine
of Christ from those of earlier times is that the men who
accepted it strove to understand and to fulfil it more and
more perfectly; whereas the doctrine of the Church
affirmed that it was already thoroughly understood and
also fulfilled.</p>

<p>However strange this may seem to us, reared as we
have been in the false doctrine of the Church, as if it
were a Christian institution, and taught to despise
heresy, it is nevertheless in that which men call heresy
that true progress, that is, true Christianity, was manifested,
and it only ceased to be such when these heresies
were checked, and it was, so to speak, stamped with the
immutable imprint of the Church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>What, then, is heresy? Read all the theological works
which treat of heresies, of that subject which above all
others calls for an exact definition, for every theologian
speaks of the true doctrine in the midst of the false ones
by which it is surrounded, and nowhere will you find
even the shadow of a definition of heresy.</p>

<p>As an instance of the complete absence of the definition
of what is understood by the word heresy, we will
quote the opinion of a learned Christian historian, E. de
Pressensé in "Histoire du Dogme," with its epigraph,
"Ubi Christus, ibi Ecclesia" (Paris, 1869). This is what
he says in his preface (p. 4):&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know that they dispute our right to qualify thus"
(that is, to pronounce them heretical) "the tendencies
which were so actively resisted by the early Fathers.
The very name of heresy seems an attack upon liberty
of conscience and thought. We cannot share these
scruples, for they would simply deprive Christianity
of any individual character."</p>

<p>And having said that after Constantine the Church did
in fact abuse its authority to describe the dissenters as
heretics and to persecute them, he says, in speaking of
the early ages of Christianity: "The Church is a free
association; there is an advantage to be gained in separating
from it. The controversy against error is based
on feelings and ideas; no uniform body of dogma has
as yet been adopted; differences of secondary importance
appear in the East and West with perfect freedom;
theology is not limited by unalterable formulas. If
amid these varying opinions a common groundwork of
faith is discerned, have we not the right to see in this,
not a definite system devised and formulated by the
representatives of a school, but faith itself in its most unerring
instinct and spontaneous manifestation? If this
very unanimity which is revealed in the essential matters
of faith is found to be antagonistic to certain tendencies,
have we not the right to infer that these tendencies disagreed
with the fundamental principles of Christianity?
Will not this supposition become a certainty if we recognize
in the doctrine rejected by the Church the characteristic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
features of one of the religions of the past? If
we admit that gnosticism or ebionitism are legitimate
forms of Christian thought, we must boldly declare that
Christian thought does not exist, nor does it possess any
specific characteristic by which it may be recognized.
We should destroy it even while pretending to enlarge
its limits. In the time of Plato no one would have dared
to advocate a doctrine which would leave no room for the
theory of ideas, and he would have been subjected to the
well-deserved ridicule of Greece, if he attempted to make
of Epicurus or of Zeno a disciple of the Academy. Let
us then admit that if there exists a religion or a doctrine
called Christianity, it may have its heresies."</p>

<p>The writer's argument amounts to this, that every
opinion which does not accord with the code of dogmas
that we have professed at any given time, is a heresy.
At a certain time and in a certain place men make a
certain profession, but this profession can never be a
fixed criterion of the truth. All is summed up in the
"Ubi Christus, ibi Ecclesia," and Christ is wherever we
are.</p>

<p>Every so-called heresy which claims that what it professes
is the actual truth, may likewise find in the history
of the Church a consistent explanation of the faith
it professes, and apply all the arguments to its own use.
Pressensé simply calls his own creed Christian truth,
precisely as every heretical sect has done.</p>

<p>The primary definition of the word heresy (the word
&#7937;&#8055;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962; means a part) is the name given by a society of
men to any opinion contradicting any part of the doctrine
professed by the society. A more specific meaning
is an expression of an opinion which denies the truth of
the creed, established and maintained by the temporal
power.</p>

<p>There is a remarkable, although little known, work entitled
"Unpartheyische Kirchen und Ketzer-Historie,"
1729, by Gottfried Arnold, which treats of this subject, and
points out the illegality, the perversity, the lack of sense,
and the cruelty of employing the word heresy in the
sense of refutation. This book is an attempt to relate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the history of Christianity in the form of a history of
heresies.</p>

<p>In his introduction the author asks a series of questions:
(1) Of those who make heretics (Von denen
Ketzermachern selbst); (2) Of those who have become
heretics; (3) Of the subjects of heresy; (4) Of the ways
of making heretics; and (5) Of the aims and consequences
of the making of heretics. To each of these
points he adds scores of other questions, giving the
answers from the works of well-known theologians, but
principally leaving it to the reader to draw his own deductions
from the contents of the book. As instances
of questions which are to a certain extent their own
answers I will quote the following:&mdash;Concerning the
4th question, of the methods for making heretics, he asks
in one of the questions (the 7th): "Does not all history
tend to show us that the greatest makers of heretics, the
adepts in the art, were those very wiseacres from whom
the Father concealed his secrets&mdash;that is, the hypocrites,
the Pharisees, and the Scribes, or utterly godless and
evil-minded men? (Question 20-21) And in the corrupted
times of Christianity did not the hypocrites and
envious ones reject the very men, talented and especially
indorsed by the Lord, who would have been highly esteemed
in periods of pure Christianity? (21) And, on
the other hand, would not those men who during the
decadence of Christianity rose above all others, and set
themselves up as teachers of the purest Christianity,
would not they, during the times of the apostles of
Christ and his disciples, have been considered as the
shameful heretics and anti-Christians?" Among other
things, while expressing the idea that the verbal declaration
of the essence of faith which was required by the
Church, the abjuration of which was regarded as a
heresy, could never cover all the ideas and beliefs of the
faithful, and that hence the requirement that faith shall
be expressed by a certain formula of words is the immediate
cause of heresy, he says in the 21st question:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And supposing that holy acts and thoughts appear
to a man so high and so profound that he finds no adequate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
words wherewith to convey them, should he be
considered a heretic if he is unable to formulate his conception?
(33) And was not this the reason why there
were no heresies in the early times of Christianity, because
Christians judged each other, not by their words,
but by their hearts and by their deeds, enjoying a perfect
freedom of expression, without the fear of being
called heretic?" "Was it not one of the convenient
and easiest methods of the Church," he asks in the
31st question, "when the ecclesiastics wished to rid
themselves of any one, or ruin his reputation, to excite
suspicion in regard to the doctrine he held, and by investing
him in the garment of heresy, condemn and cast
him out?"</p>

<p>"Although it is true that among so-called heretics sins
and errors have been committed, it is no less true, as the
numerous examples here quoted bear testimony" (that
is to say, in the history of the Church and of heresies),
"that there has never been a sincere and conscientious
man of any importance whose safety has not been endangered
through the envy of the ecclesiastics."</p>

<p>This was the interpretation of heresy almost 200
years ago, and the same meaning is attached to it to-day,
and so long as the idea of the Church shall exist it will
never change. Where the Church exists there must also
exist the idea of heresy. The Church is a body of men
claiming possession of indisputable truth. A heresy is
the opinion of men who do not acknowledge the truth of
the Church to be indisputable.</p>

<p>Heresy is the manifestation of a movement in the
Church; it is an attempt to destroy the immutable assertion
of the Church, the attempt of a living apprehension
of the doctrine. Each advance that has been made
toward the comprehension and the practice of the doctrine
has been accomplished by heretics: Tertullian,
Origen, Augustine, and Luther, Huss, Savonarola, Helchitsky,
and others were all heretics. It could not be
otherwise.</p>

<p>A disciple of Christ, who possesses an ever growing
sense of the doctrine and of its progressive fulfilment as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
it advances toward perfection, cannot, either for himself
or others, affirm, simply because he is a disciple of Christ,
that he understands and practises the doctrine of Christ
to its fullest extent; still less could he affirm this in
regard to any body of men. To whatsoever state of
comprehension and perfection he may have arrived, he
must always feel the inadequacy both of his conception
and of its application, and must ever strive for something
more satisfactory. And therefore to claim for
one's self, or for any body of men whatsoever, the possession
of a complete apprehension and practice of the
doctrine of Christ is in direct contradiction to the spirit
of Christ's doctrine itself.</p>

<p>However strange this statement may appear, every
church, as a church, has always been, and always must
be, an institution not only foreign, but absolutely hostile,
to the doctrine of Christ. It is not without reason that
Voltaire called it "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l'infâme</i>"; it is not without reason
that all so-called Christian sects believe the Church to
be the Scarlet Woman prophesied by the Revelation; it
is not without reason that the history of the Church is
the history of cruelties and horrors.</p>

<p>Churches in themselves are, as some persons believe,
institutions based upon a Christian principle, from which
they have deviated to a certain extent; but considered
in the light of churches, of bodies of men claiming infallibility,
they are anti-Christian institutions. Between
churches in the ecclesiastical sense and Christianity, not
only is there nothing in common except the name, but
they are two utterly contradictory and hostile elements.
One is pride, violence, self-assertion, inertia, and death.
The other is meekness, repentance, submission, activity,
and life.</p>

<p>No man can serve these two masters at the same time;
he must choose either the one or the other.</p>

<p>The servants of the churches of every creed, especially
in these modern times, strive to represent themselves as
the partisans of progress in Christianity; they make concessions,
they try to correct the abuses that have crept
into the Church, and protest that it is wrong to deny the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
principle of the Christian Church on account of these
abuses, because it is only through the medium of the
Church that unity can be obtained, and that the Church
is the only mediator between God and man. All this is
untrue. So far from fostering the spirit of unity, the
churches have ever been the fruitful source of human
enmity, of hatred, wars, conflicts, inquisitions, Eves of
St. Bartholomew, and so on; neither do the churches
act as the mediators between God and man,&mdash;an office,
moreover, quite unnecessary, and directly forbidden by
Christ himself, who has revealed his doctrine unto each
individual; it is but the dead formula, and not the living
God, which the churches offer to man, and which serves
rather to increase than diminish the distance between
man and his Creator. The churches, which were founded
upon a misconception, and which preserve this misconception
by their immutability, must of necessity harass
and persecute any new conception, because they know,
however they may try to conceal it, that every advance
along the road indicated by Christ is undermining their
own existence.</p>

<p>Whenever one reads or listens to the essays and sermons
in which ecclesiastical writers of modern times belonging
to the various creeds discuss the Christian truths
and virtues, when one hears and reads these artificial
arguments, these exhortations, these professions of faith,
elaborated through centuries, that now and then sound
sincere, one is almost ready to doubt if the churches can
be inimical to Christianity. "It cannot be possible that
men like John Chrysostom, Fénelon, Butler, and other
Christian preachers, could be inimical to it." One would
like to say, "The churches may have gone astray from
Christianity, may have committed errors, but they cannot
have been hostile to it." But one must first see the
fruit before he can know the tree, as Christ has taught,
and one sees that their fruits were evil, that the result of
their works has been the distortion of Christianity; and
one cannot help concluding that, however virtuous the
men may have been, the cause of the church in which
these men served was not Christian. The goodness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
virtue of certain individuals who served the churches
were peculiar to themselves, and not to the cause which
they served. All these excellent men, like Francis of
Assisi and Francis de Sales, Tichon Zadònsky, Thomas
à Kempis, and others, were good men, even though they
served a cause hostile to Christianity; and they would
have been still more charitable and more exemplary had
they not yielded obedience to false doctrines.</p>

<p>But why do we speak of, or sit in judgment on, the
past, which may be falsely represented, and is, in any
event, but little known to us? The churches, with their
principles and their works, are not of the past; we have
them with us to-day, and can judge them by their works
and by their influence over men.</p>

<p>What, then, constitutes their power? How do they
influence men? What is their work in the Greek, the
Catholic, and in all the Protestant denominations? and
what are the consequences of such work?</p>

<p>The work of our Russian so-called Orthodox Church
is visible to all. It is a factor of primary importance,
which can neither be concealed nor disputed.</p>

<p>In what manner is the activity of the Russian Church
displayed,&mdash;that vast institution which labors with so
much zeal, that institution which numbers among its servants
half a million of men, and costs the people tens of
millions?</p>

<p>The activity of the Church consists in forcing, by every
means in its power, upon the one hundred millions of
Russian people, those antiquated, time-worn beliefs which
have lost all significance, and which were formerly professed
by foreigners, with whom we had nothing in common,
beliefs in which nearly every man has lost his faith,
even in some cases those very men whose duty it is to
inculcate them.</p>

<p>The endeavor to force upon the people those formulas
of the Byzantine clergy, marvelous to them and senseless
to us, concerning the Trinity, the Virgin, the sacraments,
grace, and so forth, embraces one province of the
activity of the Russian Church; another function is the
encouragement given to idolatry, in the literal sense of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the word: the veneration of holy relics and holy images,
the sacrifices offered to them in the faith that they will
hear and grant prayers. I will pass over in silence
what is written in the ecclesiastical magazines by the
clergy who possess a semblance of learning and liberality,
and will speak only of what is really done by the
clergy throughout the immense extent of Russia, among
its one hundred millions of inhabitants. What is it that
is taught to the people with such unremitting pains and
endeavor, and with so much earnestness? What is required
of them for the sake of the so-called Christian
religion?</p>

<p>I will start at the beginning, with the birth of the child.
When a child is born, we are taught that a prayer must
be read over the mother and child, in order to purify
them, for without that prayer the mother remains unclean.
For that purpose, and facing the ikons of the
saints, whom the common people simply call gods, the
priest takes the infant in his arms, reads the exhortation,
and by that means he is supposed to cleanse the
mother. Then the parents are instructed, nay, even
ordered, under penalty of punishment in the event of
non-compliance, to christen the child&mdash;that is, to let
the priest immerse it three times in the water, while
words unintelligible to all present are read, and still less
intelligible ceremonies are performed, such as the application
of oil to different parts of the body, the cutting of
the hair, the blowing and spitting of the sponsors at the
imaginary devil. All this is necessary to cleanse the
child, and make a Christian of him. Then the parents
are told that the child must receive the holy sacrament&mdash;that
is, he is to swallow, in the form of bread and
wine, a particle of the body of Christ, by which means
the child will receive the blessing of Christ, and so on.
Then they are told that as the child grows it must be
taught to pray, which means that he is to stand in front
of boards upon which the faces of Christ, the Virgin,
and the saints are painted, bow his head and body, while
with his right hand, his fingers being folded in a peculiar
manner, he touches his forehead, his shoulders, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
stomach, and utters certain Slavonic words, the commonest
of which, those which all children learn, are
the following: "Mother of God, ... Virgin, rejoice," etc.
Then the child is taught that he must repeat this&mdash;that
is, that he must make the sign of the cross whenever he
sees a church or an ikon. Furthermore, he is taught
that on a holiday (holidays are either the day on which
Christ was born, although no one knows when that took
place, or the day of his circumcision, or that on which the
Virgin died, or when the cross or the ikon was brought,
or when some fanatic beheld a vision, etc.) he should
array himself in his best clothes, go to church, buy candles,
and set them up before the ikons of the saints, give
to the priest memoranda bearing the names of the dead
who are to be prayed for, receive bread with triangular
pieces cut out of it, pray repeatedly for the health and
welfare of the Czar and bishops, as well as for himself
and his own affairs, and then kiss the cross and the hand
of the priest.</p>

<p>Thus is he taught to pray; and besides this, he is also
taught that he must perform his devotions once a year.
To perform one's devotions means to go to church and tell
one's sins to the priest, it being assumed that this recital
of one's sins to a stranger will have a purifying effect on
a man; then he is to swallow a spoonful of bread and
wine, which will purify him still more. Moreover, men
are told that if a man and woman desire to have their
sexual relation sanctified they must come to church, put
crowns of metal upon their heads, swallow some wine,
walk three times round a table, accompanied by the sound
of singing, and this will make their sexual relation holy
and entirely different from any others.</p>

<p>In daily life the observation of the following rules is
enjoined: to eat no meat nor drink no milk on certain
days, to say <em>Te Deums</em> and <em>Requiems</em> on certain other
days, to invite the priest to one's house on holidays and
present him with money; to take from the church several
times a year boards upon which are painted the images
of the saints, and to carry them on towels through fields
and houses. Before death a man must without fail receive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
a spoonful of bread and wine; and if there be time
to be anointed with oil, that is still better, for it insures
his welfare in the future life. After his death his relatives
are told that, in order to save his soul, it is well to
place in his hand a printed prayer; it is also a good
thing to read a certain book over the dead, and for his
name to be mentioned in church at stated times.</p>

<p>This is what constitutes every man's religious obligation.
But if any one wishes to take a special care of
his soul, this creed teaches that the greatest amount of
happiness may be secured in the next world by bequeathing
money for churches and monasteries, thereby obliging
the saints to pray for one. According to this faith it is
also well to visit monasteries and kiss the miraculous
ikons and the relics.</p>

<p>These are believed to impart a peculiar holiness,
strength, and grace; and to be near these objects, as
one must be in kissing them, placing tapers before
them, crawling under them, and repeating <em>Te Deums</em>
before them, greatly promotes salvation.</p>

<p>And this is the faith called Orthodox, this is the true
faith, the one which, under the garb of a Christian religion,
has been energetically taught to the people for
many centuries, and is inculcated at the present time
more vigorously than ever.</p>

<p>Let it not be said that the Orthodox teachers look
upon all this as an ancient form of faith which it was
not considered worth while to abolish, and that the
essence of the doctrine abides elsewhere. This is not
the truth. Throughout Russia, and lately with increased
energy, the entire Russian clergy teaches this faith, and
this alone. Nothing else is taught. Men may write
about other doctrines and discuss them in the capitals,
but among the hundred million inhabitants this, and
only this, is taught. The ecclesiastics may discuss
other doctrines, but only this is what is taught.</p>

<p>All this&mdash;the worship of relics and shrines&mdash;is included
in theology and the catechism; the people are
carefully instructed in all this, theoretically and practically,
by every kind of solemnity, splendor, authority,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
and violence; the people are compelled to believe in it
all; they are hypnotized, and the faith is jealously
guarded against any attempt to deliver them from these
foolish superstitions.</p>

<p>As I said in my book, I have during the course of
many years had frequent opportunities to remark the
ridicule and rude jests that have been applied to Christ's
words and doctrine, and the ecclesiastics not only failed
to condemn it, they even encouraged this scoffing; but
let a man venture to say one disrespectful word of the
ugly idol called the Iverskaya,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> sacrilegiously carried
around Moscow by intoxicated men, and a groan of indignation
will rise from these same Orthodox ecclesiastics.
In fact, it is only an external worship in the
form of idolatry that is propagated. And let it not be
said that the one does not exclude the other, that "All
therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe
and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say,
and do not" (Matthew xxiii. 3). This is said concerning
the Pharisees, who fulfilled all the outward commands
of the law, and therefore the words, "whatsoever they
bid you observe, that observe and do," refer to acts of
benevolence and charity; whereas the words, "do not
ye after their works, for they say and do not," refer to
their observances of the rites and their indifference to
works of charity, and directly contradicts the clerical
interpretation of this passage, which explains it as a
commandment which has to do only with the rites. An
external worship is hardly compatible with the service of
charity and truth; one is apt to exclude the other. It
was so with the Pharisees, and the same may be said of
our professing Christians.</p>

<p>If a man is to be saved by redemption, the sacraments,
and prayer, good works are no longer of any value to
him. It must be either the Sermon on the Mount or the
Credo. No man can believe in both, and the ecclesiastics
have chosen the latter. The Credo is taught and recited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
as a prayer in the churches, while the Sermon on the
Mount is excluded even from selections from the Bible
which are read in churches, so that the congregation
never hear it, except on the days when the entire Bible
is read. It is inevitable; the men who can believe that
a cruel and unreasonable God had condemned humanity
to eternal death and sacrificed his own Son, and who had
destined a certain portion of mankind to everlasting torture,
cannot believe in a God of love. A man who believes
in God, in the Christ who is coming in his glory to
judge and punish the dead and the living, cannot believe
in a Christ who commands us to turn the other cheek to
the offender, who forbids us to sit in judgment, and who
bids us to forgive our enemies and to love them. A man
who believes in the inspiration of the Old Testament and
in the holiness of David, who on his deathbed ordered
the murder of an old man who had offended him, and
whom he could not kill himself because he was bound
by an oath (1 Kings ii. 8,9), and many other horrors of
a similar character, in which the Old Testament abounds,
cannot believe in the moral law of Christ; a man who
believes in the doctrine and sermons of the Church,
wherein the practice of war and the penalty of death
are reconciled with Christianity, cannot believe in the
brotherhood of humanity.</p>

<p>But, above all, a man who believes in salvation
through faith, in redemption, and in the sacraments,
cannot strive with all his might to live up to the moral
precepts of Christ. A man who has been taught by
the Church the sacrilegious doctrine that he is to be
saved through a certain medium, and not by his own
efforts, will surely have recourse to that medium; he
will not trust to his own efforts, on which, he has been
assured, it is sinful to rely. Every Church, with its
doctrines of redemption and salvation, and above all,
the Orthodox faith, with its idolatry, excludes the
doctrine of Christ. But it is said, "This has always
been the faith of the people, and that they will continue
to hold it is proved by the whole history of the Russian
nation. It would be wrong to deprive them of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
their traditions." Herein lies the fallacy. The people,
it is true, did once upon a time profess something like
what is at present professed by the Church; but besides
this worship of images and relics, the people had
always a profound moral conception of Christianity
never possessed by the Church, and only met with in
her noblest representatives; but the people, in the better
class, and in spite of the obstacles raised by the State
and the Church, have long since abandoned the cruder
phase of belief, a fact that is proved by the rationalistic
sects that are beginning to spring up on every
side, sects that Russia is filled with at the present
day, and against which the ecclesiastics wage so hopeless
a warfare. The people are beginning to recognize
the moral, vital side of Christianity more and
more plainly. And now the Church appears, failing
to give them a moral support, but forcibly teaching
old-time paganism,&mdash;the Church, with its immutable
formulas, endeavoring to thrust men back into the
gloom from which they are struggling so earnestly to
escape.</p>

<p>The ecclesiastics say: "We are teaching nothing
new; it is the same faith which the people already
hold, only we teach it in a more perfect manner." It
is like binding a chicken and trying to put it back into
the shell from which it came. I have often been
struck by the spectacle, which would be simply absurd
were not its results so terrible, of men traveling, so to
speak, in a circle, deceived and deceiving, but wholly
unable to escape from the charmed circle.</p>

<p>The first question, the first doubt, that enters the
head of every Russian when he begins to reason, is a
suspicion of the miraculous ikons, and principally of
the relics: is it true that they are incorruptible, and
that they perform miracles? Hundreds and thousands
of men ask these questions, and are at a loss for an
answer, especially since bishops and metropolitans and
other eminent persons kiss both the relics and the
miraculous images. Ask the bishops and other personages
of importance why they do this, and they will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
tell you that they do it in order to impress the masses,
and the masses do it because the bishops and other
magnates do it.</p>

<p>The activity of the Russian Church, despite the
veneer of modernity and the scientific and spiritual
standards which its members have begun to establish
by their essays, their religious reviews, and their sermons,
consists not only in encouraging the people in a
coarse and grotesque idolatry, but in strengthening and
promulgating superstition and religious ignorance,
and in endeavoring to destroy the vital conception of
Christianity that exists in the people side by side with
this idolatry.</p>

<p>I remember being once in a book-shop of the monastery
of Optinæ Desert while an old peasant was
selecting spiritual reading for his educated grandson.
The monk was offering him a description of relics, of
holy days, of miraculous ikons, the Book of Psalms,
and the like. I asked the old man if he had a Bible.
"No," he replied. "Give him a Russian Bible," I
said to the monk. "We don't sell that to them," said
the monk. This, in short, is the activity of our Church.</p>

<p>But the European or American reader may say,
"That only happens in barbaric Russia," and the remark
will be correct, but only so far as it applies
to the government, which supports the Church to
maintain in our land its stupefying and demoralizing
influence.</p>

<p>It is true that there is nowhere in Europe a government
so despotic, or that is in more perfect accord
with the established Church. Therefore in Russia the
government authorities play an important part in demoralizing
the people; but it is not true that the Russian
Church differs from other churches in respect to
its influence over the people.</p>

<p>Churches are everywhere alike, and if the Catholic,
Anglican, and Lutheran have not at their beck so
submissive a government as the Russian, we may be
sure that they would not fail to take advantage of it
were it within their reach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>The Church as a church, whether it be Catholic,
Anglican, Lutheran, or Presbyterian, or any denomination
whatsoever, inasmuch as it is a church, cannot
help striving after the same object as the Russian
Church&mdash;namely, to conceal the true meaning of the
doctrine of Christ, and to substitute a meaning of its
own, which imposes no obligations, which excludes the
possibility of understanding the true, living doctrine of
Christ, and which above all justifies the existence of a
priesthood living at the expense of the people.</p>

<p>Do we not find Catholicism with its prohibition
against reading the Bible, and with its demand for implicit
obedience to the clergy and the infallible Pope?
Wherein does Catholicism differ in its preaching from
the Russian Church? The same external worship, the
same relics, miracles, and statues, miracle-performing
Madonnas and processions; the same vague and mystical
utterances concerning Christianity in books and
sermons, and all in support of the grossest idolatry.</p>

<p>And is it not the same in the Anglican or in the
Lutheran, or in any other Protestant denomination
with an established form of church?</p>

<p>The same demands that the congregation shall acknowledge
a belief in dogmas which were defined in
the fourth century, and which have lost all meaning
for the men of our time; the same call for idol worship,
if not of relics or ikons, at least of the Sabbath and
the letter of the Bible; the same endeavor to conceal
the real requirement of Christianity and the substitution
of exterior rites, and "cant," as the English so
happily define the tendency which finds such sway
among them.</p>

<p>This activity is more noticeable in Protestantism, because
that creed has not even the excuse of antiquity.
And is not the same thing going on in the present
"Revivalism," a regenerated Calvinism, which has given
birth to the Salvation Army? Inasmuch as the attitude
of all ecclesiastical dogmas toward the doctrine
of Christ is very much the same, so are their methods
of a similar character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>The attitude they have taken obliges them to make
every effort to conceal the doctrine of that Christ in
whose name they speak.</p>

<p>The disparity between ecclesiastical creeds and the
doctrine of Christ is so great that a special effort is
required to keep mankind in ignorance. Indeed, one
needs but to consider the position of any adult, I do not
say educated, but one who has assimilated superficially
the current notions concerning geology, physics, chemistry,
cosmography, and history, when for the first time
he actually reflects on the faith impressed upon him
in his childhood, and maintained by the Church, concerning
the creation of the world in six days, the
appearance of light before the sun was created, the
story of Noah's ark and the animals preserved in it,&mdash;concerning
Jesus and his divine origin as the Son of
God who created all things before time existed; that
this God came down to earth because of Adam's sin;
that he rose from the dead, ascended into heaven, and
sits on the right hand of the Father; that he will come
in the clouds to judge the living and the dead, etc.</p>

<p>All these ideas evolved by the men of the fourth
century, which had for them a certain meaning, have
none whatever for us. The present generation may
repeat these words, but it can never believe in them,
because the statements that God dwells in heaven, that
the heavens opened and a voice was heard to utter
certain words, that Christ arose from the dead and
ascended into heaven, that he will come again from
some place in the clouds, etc., have no meaning for us.</p>

<p>It was possible for a man who believed that heaven
was a substantial arch of limited dimensions to believe
or to disbelieve that God created it, that it opened, and
that Christ ascended thither,&mdash;but for us there is no
sense in such ideas. Men of our time can only affirm
that it is one's duty to believe all this,&mdash;which they
do. But they cannot really believe in what has no
meaning in it for them.</p>

<p>But if all these utterances are supposed to have an
allegorical signification and are only intended as similes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
then we know in the first place that all the churchmen
will not agree to this&mdash;on the contrary, the majority
insist on taking the Scriptures literally; and in the
second place, that these interpretations differ greatly,
and are supported by no reliable authority.</p>

<p>And even if a man wished to believe the doctrine of
the Church as it is taught, the increase of culture, the
reading of the Bible, and the intercourse among the
members of different churches, form a greater and
more insurmountable obstacle to belief.</p>

<p>Nowadays a man has but to buy the Bible for threepence,
and to read the simple, indisputable words of
Christ to the Samaritan woman, that the Father seeketh
worshipers neither in Jerusalem nor in this or that
mountain, but worshipers in spirit and truth; or the
words, that a Christian should pray not like the heathen
in the temples, nor at the corners of streets, but in the
secrecy of his closet; or, that a disciple of Christ may
call no one father or mother,&mdash;one has but to read
these words to be indubitably convinced that priests
who call themselves teachers in opposition to the teaching
of Christ, and dispute among themselves, cannot
be authorities, and that that which they teach is not
Christian.</p>

<p>But this is not enough. If the modern man were to
go on believing in miracles and never read the Bible, the
fellowship with men of other creeds and professions,
which is so much a matter of course in these days, will
compel him to question the truth of his religion. It was
natural enough for a man who had never met a believer
in a creed different from his own, to think that his was
the only faith; but an intelligent man has but to encounter&mdash;and
that is an everyday occurrence&mdash;good
and bad men of all creeds, who criticize each other's
beliefs, in order to question the truth of his own religion.
Now, only a man either totally ignorant or indifferent
to the problems of life as dealt with by religion can
remain in the faith of the Church.</p>

<p>What shrewdness is needed, and what efforts must
the churches make, in order to go on, in the face of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
these faith-destroying influences, building temples, saying
masses, preaching, instructing, converting, and above
all receiving for this the large compensations which all
those priests, pastors, stewards, superintendents, abbots,
archdeacons, bishops, and archbishops receive!</p>

<p>A special and supernatural effort is called for, and to
this the Church responds, exerting herself more and more.
In Russia, besides many other measures, they employ a
simple, rude violence, by virtue of the power invested in
the Church. People who shrink from an outward observance
of faith and who do not conceal the fact are
simply punished or deprived of their civil rights; and
to those who strictly comply with the rites, privileges
and rewards are granted.</p>

<p>So much for the Orthodoxy; but every church, without
exception, makes the most of the means at its disposal,
and hypnotism is one of the chief agents.</p>

<p>Every art, from architecture to poetry, is enlisted, in
order to move and intoxicate the human soul. This hypnotic
and mesmerizing influence is markedly displayed
in the activity of the Salvation Army, which employs
novel, and to us abnormal, methods, such, for instance,
as drums, horns, singing, banners, uniforms, processions,
dancing, outbursts of tears, and dramatic gestures.</p>

<p>Still, these methods are startling simply because of
their novelty. Is not the familiar form of worship in
cathedrals, with their peculiar illumination, the golden
pomp, the candles, choirs, organs, bells, vestments, the
weeping preachers, etc., of a similar nature? And yet,
however powerful may be the influence of this hypnotism,
it is by no means the chief or most harmful form
which the activity of the Church assumes. Its most
malign activity is that which is devoted to deceiving
the children&mdash;those little ones of whom Jesus has said,
"Woe be unto him who tempts the least of these." From
the earliest awakening of a child's intelligence he is
deceived and formally taught that which his teachers
no longer believe themselves, and this goes on until the
delusion becomes from habit a part of his nature. A
child is systematically deceived concerning the most important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
affair in life, and when this deception has become
so incorporated with his being that it is difficult to uproot
it, then the world of science and reality is opened
to him&mdash;a world that is wholly at variance with the
faith which he has imbibed from his teachers&mdash;and he
is left to reconcile those contradictions as best he may.</p>

<p>Given the problem of how to muddle a man so that
he will be unable to discriminate between two antagonistic
conceptions that have been taught to him since his
childhood, one could never have devised anything more
effectual than the education of every young man in our
so-called Christian society.</p>

<p>Shocking as it is to contemplate the work of the
churches among men, still, if we consider their position,
we shall see that they cannot act otherwise. They are
face to face with a dilemma: the Sermon on the Mount
or the Nicene creed; the one excludes the other. If a
man sincerely believes the Sermon on the Mount, the
Nicene creed must inevitably lose all its meaning for
him, and the same would hold true as regards the Church
and its representatives; but if a man accepts the Nicene
creed, that is to say, the Church, or those who call themselves
its representatives, then he will find no use for
the Sermon on the Mount. Hence it is incumbent on
the churches to make every effort to obscure the meaning
of the Sermon on the Mount and to endeavor to
draw the people toward them. It is only due to their
intense activity in that direction that the influence of
the churches has not decreased. Let the Church but
pause in this effort to influence the masses by hypnotizing
men and deceiving children for ever so short a time,
and men will comprehend the doctrine of Christ, and
this comprehension will do away with churches and their
influence. Therefore the churches cease not for one
moment their compulsory activity through the hypnotism
of adults and the deception of children. And it is this
activity of the churches that gives people a false conception
of Christ's doctrine, and prevents the majority of
men, the so-called believers, from understanding it.</p>

<h3>MISCONCEPTION OF CHRISTIANITY BY SCIENTISTS</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The relation of scientists to religions in general&mdash;What are religions, and
their significance to human life&mdash;Three conceptions of life&mdash;The
Christian doctrine is the expression of the divine life-conception&mdash;The
misconception of Christianity by scientists who study its outward
manifestations due to the fact that they consider it from the standpoint
of the social life-conception&mdash;Opinion resulting therefrom, that
the teaching of Christ is exaggerated and unpractical&mdash;The expression
of the life-conception of the gospel&mdash;Erroneous judgments of scientists
concerning Christianity are based upon the assurance that they
possess an infallible criterion of knowledge&mdash;Hence arise two misapprehensions
in regard to the Christian doctrine&mdash;The first misapprehension
concerning the impracticability of the doctrine arises from
the fact that the Christian doctrine presents a conduct of life different
from that of the social life-conception&mdash;Christianity offers not a rule,
but an ideal&mdash;Christ adds the consciousness of a divine power to that
of an animal power&mdash;Christianity seems to exclude the possibility of
life only when the indication of the ideal is taken for the rule&mdash;An
ideal cannot be belittled&mdash;According to the doctrine of Christ, life is
movement&mdash;The ideal and the commandments&mdash;The second misapprehension
arises from the attempt to replace the love of God and His
service by the love and service of humanity&mdash;Scientists believe that
Christianity and their doctrine concerning the service of humanity are
identical&mdash;The doctrine of love toward humanity has for its foundation
the social life-conception&mdash;The love for humanity which springs
logically from love for the individual has no meaning, because humanity
is a fiction&mdash;Christian love springing from the love of God has for
its object not only humanity but the whole world&mdash;Christianity teaches
a life in accordance with its divine nature&mdash;It indicates that the essence
of a man's soul is love, and that its good is obtained from its love of
God, whom he feels to be within him through love.</p></blockquote>


<p>Let us now turn our attention to another fallacious
conception of Christianity, which is antagonistic to its
actual principles,&mdash;the scientific conception.</p>

<p>The Christianity of the churchmen is something which
they have evolved for themselves, and which they believe
to be the only true interpretation of Christian doctrine.</p>

<p>The scientists take the professions of faith of the
various churches for Christianity, and assuming that
these dogmas embody an exhaustive definition of Christian
doctrine, they affirm that Christianity has had its day.</p>

<p>One needs but to take into consideration the important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
part which all religions, and especially Christianity,
have played in the life of man, and the significance
which science attaches to them, to see at once how
impossible it would be to obtain any just apprehension
of Christian doctrine through these conceptions. As
each individual must possess certain impressions in
regard to the meaning of his life, and, though often
unconsciously, conform his conduct thereunto, so mankind
in the aggregate, or groups of men living under
the same conditions, must likewise possess a conception
of the meaning of their common life and its consequent
activities. As an individual passing from one period of
life to another inevitably changes his ideas, the point
of view of a grown-up man differs from that of a child,
so also mankind in the aggregate&mdash;the nation&mdash;inevitably,
and in conformity with its age, changes its views
of life and the activity that springs therefrom.</p>

<p>The difference in this respect between an individual
and mankind in general lies in the fact that while the
individual, in forming his conception of the significance
and responsibilities of that new period of life upon
which he is about to enter, may avail himself of the
advice of his predecessors who have already passed
that stage, mankind can have no such advantage, because
it is advancing along an unbeaten track and
there is no one of whom it can ask for the clue to the
mystery of life, or how it shall demean itself under
these unfamiliar conditions to which no nation has ever
yet been subjected.</p>

<p>The married man with a family of children will not
continue to view life as he did when he was a child;
neither is it possible for mankind, with the many changes
that have taken place,&mdash;the density of the population,
the constant intercourse of nations, the perfected means
of combating the forces of nature, and the increase of
knowledge generally,&mdash;to view the life of the present
day in the light of the past; hence it becomes necessary
to evolve a life-conception from which activities
corresponding with a new system which is to be established
will naturally develop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>And this need is supplied by that peculiar capacity
of the race for producing men able to impart a new
significance to human life,&mdash;a significance developing
a different set of activities.</p>

<p>The birth of the life-conception, which always takes
place when mankind enters upon new conditions and
its subsequent activities, is what we call religion.</p>

<p>Therefore, in the first place, religion is not, as science
regards it, a phenomenon which formerly traveled hand
in hand with the development of mankind, and which
has since been left behind; on the contrary, it is a
phenomenon inherent to human existence itself, and
never more distinctly manifested than at the present
day. In the second place, religion defines future rather
than past activities; therefore it is evident that an investigation
of the phenomena of the past can by no
means touch the essence of religion.</p>

<p>The longing to typify the forces of nature is no more
the essence of religion than is the fear of those same
forces, or the need of the miraculous and its outward
manifestations, as the scientists suppose. The essence
of religion lies in the power of man to foreknow and
to point out the way in which mankind must walk. It
is a definition of a new life which will give birth to new
activities.</p>

<p>This faculty of foreknowledge concerning the destiny
of humanity is more or less common, no doubt, to all
people; still from time to time a man appears in whom
the faculty has reached a higher development, and these
men have the power clearly and distinctly to formulate
that which is vaguely conceived by all men, thus instituting
a new life-conception from which is to flow an
unwonted activity, whose results will endure for centuries
to come. Thus far there have been three of
these life-conceptions; two of them belong to a bygone
era, while the third is of our own time and is called
Christianity. It is not that we have merged the various
conceptions of the significance of life into three arbitrary
divisions, but that there really have been but three
distinct conceptions, by which the actions of mankind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
have been influenced, and save through these we have
no means of comprehending life.</p>

<p>These three life-conceptions are&mdash;firstly, the individual
or animal; secondly, the social or pagan; and
thirdly, the universal or divine.</p>

<p>According to the first of these, a man's life is his personality,
and that only, and his life's object is to gratify
his desires. According to the second, his life is not
limited to his own personality; it includes the sum and
continuity of many personalities,&mdash;of the family, of the
race, and of the State, and his life's object is to gratify
the will of the communities of individuals. And according
to the third, his life is confined neither to his personality
nor to that of the aggregate of individuals, but
finds its significance in the eternal source of all life,&mdash;in
God Himself.</p>

<p>These three life-conceptions serve as the basis for the
religions of every age.</p>

<p>The savage sees life only through the medium of his
own desires. He cares for nothing but himself, and for
him the highest good is the full satisfaction of his own
passions. The incentive of his life is personal enjoyment.
His religion consists of attempts to propitiate
the gods in his favor, and of the worship of imaginary
deities, who exist only for their own personal ends.</p>

<p>A member of the pagan world recognizes life as
something concerning others besides himself; he sees
it as concerning an aggregate of individuals,&mdash;the
family, the race, the nation, the State, and is ready to
sacrifice himself for the aggregate. The incentive of
his life is glory. His religion consists in honoring the
chiefs of his race, his progenitors, his ancestors, his
sovereigns, and in the worship of those gods who are
the exclusive patrons of his family, his tribe, his race,
and his State.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>
<p>The man who possesses the divine life-conception
neither looks upon life as centered in his own personality
nor in that of mankind at large, whether family,
tribe, race, nation, or State; but rather does he conceive
of it as taking its rise in the eternal life of God, and to
fulfil His will he is ready to sacrifice his personal, family,
and social well-being. Love is the impelling motive of
his life, and his religion is the worship, in deed and in
truth, of the beginning of all things,&mdash;of God Himself.</p>

<p>History is but the transcript of the gradual transition
from the animal life-conception of the individual to the
social, and from the social to the divine. The history
of the ancients for thousands of centuries, culminating
in that of Rome, is the history of the evolution from the
animal life-conception of the individual to that of society
and the State. From the advent of Christianity and the
fall of Imperial Rome we have the history of that change
which is still going on from the social to the divine life-conception.</p>

<p>The latter, together with the Christian doctrine which
is based upon it, and by which our lives are shaped, and
our activities, both practical and scientific, are quickened,
is regarded by the pseudo-scientists, who judge it only by
its outward signs, as something outlived, which has lost
all meaning for us.</p>

<p>According to scientists this doctrine is embodied in
the dogmas of the Trinity, the Redemption, the miracles,
the Church and its sacraments, etc., and is only
one of the many religions which have arisen during the
progress of human history, and now, having played its
part and outlived its time, is vanishing before the dawn
of science and true enlightenment.</p>

<p>The grossest of human errors spring in most cases
from the fact that men who stand on a low intellectual
plane, when they encounter phenomena of a higher order,
instead of trying to rise to the higher plane from which
these phenomena may be fitly regarded, and making an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
effort to understand them, judge them by their own low
standard, and the less they know of what they speak,
the more bold and determined are their judgments.</p>

<p>Most scientists, who treat of the moral doctrine of
Christ from the lower standpoint of a social life-conception,
regard it as nothing more than an amalgam without
cohesion of the asceticism of India with the doctrine
of the Stoics and Neo-Platonists, and of vague anti-social
dreams, devoid of all serious meaning in these latter
days; they simply see its outward manifestation in the
form of dogmas in Catholicism, in Protestantism, and in
its struggle with the powers of the world. Interpreting
the design of Christianity from its outward aspects, they
are like unto deaf men, who judge of the meaning and
excellence of music by the movements of the musicians.</p>

<p>Hence it is that all such men, from Comte and Strauss
to Spencer and Renan, not understanding the purport of
Christ's words, knowing nothing whatever of their intention,
ignorant of the question to which they serve as an
answer, and taking no pains to learn it,&mdash;such men, if
they are inimical to Christianity, utterly deny the sense
of the doctrine; but if they are leniently inclined, then,
from the height of their superior wisdom, they amend it,
taking for granted that Christ would have said what they
think He meant, had He known how to express himself.
They treat His doctrine just as men of overweening
self-conceit treat their inferiors, correcting them in their
speech: "You mean so and so." And the spirit of
emendation is always such as to reduce the doctrine of
the higher, the divine life-conception, to that of the
lower and the social conception.</p>

<p>It is usually admitted that the moral teaching of
Christianity is good but exaggerated; that in order to
make it perfect, its hyperboles, which are incompatible
with our present mode of life, should be discarded. "A
doctrine which requires so much that is impracticable is
more hurtful than one which demands of men only what
is in proportion to their strength." Thus declare the
learned interpreters of Christianity, thus unwittingly
reiterating the assertion of those who misunderstood the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Christian doctrine long years ago, and crucified the
Master.</p>

<p>The Hebrew law, "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for
a tooth," the retributive justice known to mankind thousands
of years ago, seems far better suited to the court
of contemporary scientists than the law of love which
Christ preached 1800 years ago, and which was to replace
this identical law of justice.</p>

<p>It would seem that every action of those men who
accepted the teaching of Christ in its literal sense, and
lived up to it, all the words and deeds of sincere Christians,
and all the agencies which, under the guise of
socialism and communism, are now transforming the
world, are merely exaggeration, not worth discussing.
Nations which have lived under Christian influences, and
which are now represented by their advanced thinkers,
the scientists, have arrived at the conclusion that the
Christian doctrine is a matter of dogma; that its practical
teaching has been a mistake and an exaggeration,
inimical to the just requirements of morality that are in
accord with human nature, and that the very doctrine
which Christ repudiated, and for which he substituted a
dogma of his own, is far better suited to us. The scientist
considers the commandment of non-resistance to
evil by violence an exaggeration, and even an act of
folly. It would be far better, in his opinion, to reject
it, never dreaming that it is not the doctrine of Christ
which he is controverting, but something which he
assumes to be the doctrine in question. He does not
realize when he says that the commandment of non-resistance
in the doctrine of Christ is an exaggeration,
that he is like one who, teaching the theory of the circle,
declares that the equality of the radii is an exaggeration.
It is just as if one who has no idea of the form of a circle
were to affirm that the law which requires that each point
of its circumference shall be equidistant from its center,
is an exaggeration. As a suggestion to reject or modify
the proposition concerning the equality of the radii of a
circle signifies an ignorance in regard to the circle itself,
so also does the idea of rejecting or modifying, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
practical teaching of Christ, the commandment of non-resistance
to evil by violence signify a misunderstanding
of the doctrine.</p>

<p>And those who entertain these views do not really
comprehend the doctrine. They do not understand that
it is the unfolding of a new conception of life, corresponding
to the new phase of existence upon which the
world entered 1800 years ago, and a definition of the
new activity to which it gave birth. Either they do not
believe that Christ said what He meant to say, or that
what is found in the Sermon on the Mount and elsewhere
He said either from His enthusiasm or lack of
wisdom and simplicity of character.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Matt. vi. 25-34.&mdash;25. <em>Therefore I say unto you, Take no
thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink;
nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life
more than meat, and the body than raiment?</em></p>

<p>29. <em>And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his
glory was not arrayed like one of these.</em></p>

<p>30. <em>Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which

more clothe you, O ye of little faith?</em></p>

<p>31. <em>Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat?
or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?</em></p>

<p>32. <em>(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for

<p><em>Not what I wish, but what Thou wishest, and not as I wish,
but as Thou wishest. Life consists in doing not your own will,
but the will of God.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>All these doctrines are regarded by men who adhere
to the lower life-conception as expressions of enthusiastic
exaltation, with no special reference to daily life.
And yet these doctrines are no less the natural outcome
of the Christian life-conception than is the idea of giving
one's labor for the common good, or of sacrificing
one's life to defend one's country, the outcome of the
social life-conception.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>As the believer in the social life-conception says to
the savage: "Rouse yourself! Consider what you are
doing! The life that man lives for himself alone cannot
be the true one, for life is fleeting and full of woe.
It is the life of the community at large, the race, the
family, the State, that endures: therefore a man must
sacrifice his personality for the life of the family and
the State;" Christianity in like manner says unto him
who believes in a social life-conception of the community:
"Repent, &#956;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#949;&#964;&#945;, that is, arouse yourself,
consider your ways, else shall you perish. Know you
that this bodily, animal life is born to-day and dies to-morrow;
nothing can assure its permanence, no outward
expedients, no system whatsoever can give it stability.
Consider your ways and learn that the life you live is
not the real life, that neither family, social, nor State life
will save you from perdition. An honest rational life
is possible for man provided that he be, not a participant
of the life of the family or life of the State, but a
partaker of the source of all life&mdash;that of the Father
Himself; then his life is united to the life of the Father."
Such is beyond a doubt the meaning of the Christian
conception of life, clearly set forth in every maxim of
the New Testament.</p>

<p>One may not share such a conception of life, one may
deny it, or prove it to be inaccurate and fallacious; but
no man can possibly judge a doctrine without having
first made himself familiar with the life-conception which
forms its basis; and still more impossible is it to judge
a lofty subject from a low standpoint, to pronounce upon
the belfry from a knowledge of the foundation. Yet this
is precisely what is done by contemporary scientists.
And this is because they are laboring under an error
similar to that of the clergy, in believing that they possess
such infallible methods of studying their subject
that, if they but bring their so-called scientific methods
to bear upon the subject under consideration, there can
be no doubt as to the accuracy of their conclusion.</p>

<p>The possession of a guide to knowledge, which they
believe to be infallible, is really the chief obstacle to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
comprehension of the Christian doctrine among unbelievers
and so-called scientists, by whose opinions the
great majority of unbelievers, the so-called educated
classes, are guided. All the errors of the scientists concerning
Christianity, and especially two strange misapprehensions
that avail more than anything else to blind
men to its real signification, arise therefrom.</p>

<p>One of these misapprehensions is that the doctrine of
a Christian life not being practical, it remains optional
with the individual whether he take it for his guide or
no; and if he chooses to do so, it may then be modified
to suit the exigencies of our social life. The second
misapprehension is that the Christian doctrine of love
of God, and therefore of the service due to Him, is a
mystical requirement, neither clearly expressed nor offering
any well-defined object of love: consequently the
more definite and intelligible doctrine of love of man and
of the service of humanity may be substituted for it.</p>

<p>The first misapprehension which relates to the impracticability
of the Christian doctrine arises from the fact
that men who believe in the social life-conception, not
comprehending the rule obeyed by men who hold the
Christian doctrine, and mistaking the Christian standard
of perfection for the guiding principle of life, believe and
declare that it is impossible to follow the teaching of
Christ, because implicit obedience to this doctrine would
end by destroying life. "If man were to fulfil the precepts
of Christ, he would destroy his life; and if all the
world were to fulfil them, the human race would soon
become extinct. If you were to take no thought for the
morrow, neither of what ye shall eat or drink, nor what
ye shall put on; if one may not resist evil by violence
or defend one's life, nor even give up one's life for his
friend; if one is to preserve absolute chastity, mankind
could not long exist;" so they believe and affirm.</p>

<p>And they are right, if one takes the incentives to perfection
offered by the teaching of Christ as laws which
each man must obey, just as, for instance, in the social
order every man must pay his taxes, and some must
serve in the courts of law, and so on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>The misapprehension consists in overlooking the fact
that the doctrine of Christ, and the doctrine formulated
by a lower life-conception, guide men in very different
ways. The doctrines of the social life-conception guide
men in fulfilling the requirements of the law. The doctrine
of Christ guides men by manifesting the infinite perfection
of the Heavenly Father, to which it is natural for
every man to aspire, whatever may be his shortcomings.</p>

<p>The misconception of those who judge the Christian
doctrine by the standard of the state or civil doctrine is
this,&mdash;that they imagine that the perfection of which
Christ speaks may be attained in this life, and ask themselves
just as they would ask concerning some law of the
State, what will happen when all this shall be fulfilled?
This hypothesis is fallacious, because the perfection indicated
by Christianity is infinite and can never be
attained; and Christ promulgates his doctrine, knowing
that although absolute perfection will never be attained,
yet the aspiration toward it will ever contribute to the
welfare of mankind, that this welfare may by this means
be everlastingly increased.</p>

<p>Christ is not teaching angels, but men who live and
move in an animal life, and whose impulses are of an
animal nature. And to this animal impulse Christ, so
to speak, adds another force by communicating to man
a sense of the divine perfection, guiding the current of
life between these two forces.</p>

<p>To take it for granted that human life is to follow the
direction indicated by Christ would be like expecting the
boatman, who, crossing a swift river, steers almost directly
against the current, to float in that direction.</p>

<p>Christ recognizes the fact that a parallelogram has
two sides, and that a man's life is controlled by two
indestructible forces: his animal nature and his consciousness
of a filial relationship to God. Disregarding
the factor of the animal life, which never looses its hold,
and is beyond man's control, Christ speaks of the divine
consciousness, urging man to its fuller recognition, its
complete emancipation from all that fetters it, and to its
utmost development.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Man's true life, according to the precepts of Christ, is
only to be found in this emancipation and in the growth
of the divine consciousness. According to the old dispensation,
a true life meant the fulfilment of the precepts
of the law; but according to Christ, it means the
closest approach to the divine perfection which has been
manifested to every man, and which every man recognizes,&mdash;a
closer and closer union of his will to the will
of God; a union which every man is striving to attain,
and which would utterly destroy the life we now lead.</p>

<p>God's perfection is the asymptote of human life, toward
which it is forever aspiring and drawing nearer, although
it can only reach its goal in the infinite.</p>

<p>It is only when men mistake the suggestion of an ideal
for a rule of conduct that the Christian doctrine seems
at odds with life. Indeed, the reverse is true, for it is
by the doctrine of Christ, and that alone, that a true
life is rendered possible. "It is a mistake to require
too much," men usually say, when discussing the demands
of the Christian religion. "One ought not to
be required to take no thought for the morrow, as the
Bible teaches, but of course one should not be over-anxious;
one cannot give all that he possesses to the
poor, still he should bestow a certain portion of his
goods in charity; one ought not to remain unmarried,
but let him avoid a dissolute life; one need not renounce
his wife and children, although one must not
idolize them."</p>

<p>These arguments are equivalent to telling a man who
is crossing a swift river and steering his boat against
the current, that no one can cross a river by steering
against the current, but that he must direct his boat in
a straight line toward the point he wishes to reach.</p>

<p>The doctrine of Christ differs from former doctrines
in that it influences men, not by outward observances,
but by the interior consciousness that divine perfection
may be attained.</p>

<p>It is this illimitable and divine perfection that absorbs
the soul of man, not restricted laws of justice and philanthropy.
It needs but the aspiration toward this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
divine perfection to impel the course of human life
from the animal to the divine, so far as may be humanly
possible.</p>

<p>In order to land at any given point one must steer
beyond it. To lower the standard of an ideal means
not only to lessen the chances of attaining perfection,
but to destroy the ideal itself. The ideal that influences
mankind is not an ingenious invention; it is something
that dwells in the soul of each individual. It is this
ideal of utter and infinite perfection that excites men
and urges them to action. A possible degree of perfection
would have no appeal to the souls of men.</p>

<p>It is because the doctrine of Christ requires illimitable
perfection, that is to say, the blending of the divine
essence, which is in each man's soul, with the will of
God, the union of the Son with the Father, that it has
authority. It is only the emancipation of the Son of
God, who dwells with each one of us, from the animal
element within us, and the drawing near to the Father,
that can, in the Christian sense of the word, be called
life.</p>

<p>The presence of the animal element in man is not
enough of itself to constitute human life. Neither is a
spiritual life, which is guided only by the will of God, a
human life. A true human life is composed of an animal
and of a spiritual life united to the will of God, and
the nearer this component life approaches to the life of
God, the more it has life.</p>

<p>According to the Christian doctrine, life is a condition
of progress toward the perfection of God; hence
no one condition can be either higher or lower than
another, because each is in itself a certain stage in
human progress toward the unattainable perfection,
and therefore of equal importance with all the others.
Any spiritual quickening, according to this doctrine, is
simply an accelerated movement toward perfection.
Therefore the impulse of Zacchæus the publican, of the
adulteress, and the thief on the cross, show forth a
higher order of life than does the passive righteousness
of the Pharisee. This doctrine, therefore, can never be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
enforced by obligatory laws. The man who, from a
lower plane, lives up to the doctrine he professes, ever
advancing toward perfection, leads a higher life than
one who may perhaps stand on a superior plane of
morality, but who is making no progress toward perfection.</p>

<p>Thus the stray lamb is dearer to the Father than
those which are in the fold; the prodigal returned, the
coin that was lost and is found again, more highly prized
than those that never were lost.</p>

<p>Since the fulfilment of this doctrine is an impulse
from self toward God, it is evident that there can be no
fixed laws for its movement. It may spring from any
degree of perfection or of imperfection; the fulfilment
of rules and fulfilment of the doctrine are by no means
synonymous; there could be no rules or obligatory laws
for its fulfilment.</p>

<p>The difference between social laws and the doctrine
of Christ is the natural result of the radical dissimilarity
between the doctrine of Christ and those earlier doctrines
which had their source in a social life-conception.
The latter are for the most part positive, enjoining certain
acts, by the performance of which men are to be
justified and made righteous, whereas the Christian precepts
(the precept of love is not a commandment in the
strict sense of the word, but the expression of the very
essence of the doctrine), the five commandments of the
Sermon on the Mount, are all negative, only meant to
show men who have reached a certain degree of development
what they must avoid. These commandments
are, so to speak, mile-stones on the infinite road
to perfection, toward which humanity is struggling;
they mark the degrees of perfection which it is possible
for it to attain at a certain period of its development.</p>

<p>In the Sermon on the Mount Christ expressed the
eternal ideal to which mankind instinctively aspires,
showing at the same time the point of perfection to
which human nature in its present stage may attain.</p>

<p>The ideal is to bear no malice, excite no ill-will, and
to love all men. The commandment which forbids us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
to offend our neighbor is one which a man who is striving
to attain this ideal must not do less than obey. And
this is the first commandment.</p>

<p>The ideal is perfect chastity in thought, no less than
in deed; and the commandment which enjoins purity in
married life, forbidding adultery, is one which every
man who is striving to attain this ideal must not do less
than obey. And this is the second commandment.</p>

<p>The ideal is to take no thought for the morrow, to live
in the present, and the commandment, the fulfilment of
which is the point beneath which we must not fall, is
against taking oath or making promises for the future.
Such is the third commandment.</p>

<p>The ideal&mdash;to use no violence whatsoever&mdash;shows us
that we must return good for evil, endure injuries with
patience, and give up the cloak to him who has taken
the coat. Such is the fourth commandment.</p>

<p>The ideal is to love your enemies, to do good to them
that despitefully use you. In order to keep the spirit
of this commandment one must at least refrain from
injuring one's enemies, one must speak kindly of them,
and treat all one's fellow-creatures with equal consideration.
Such is the fifth commandment.</p>

<p>All these commandments are reminders of that which
we, in our striving for perfection, must and can avoid;
reminders, too, that we must labor now to acquire by
degrees habits of self-restraint, until such habits become
second nature. But these commandments, far from exhausting
the doctrine, do not by any means cover it.
They are but stepping-stones on the way to perfection,
and must necessarily be followed by higher and still
higher ones, as men pursue the course toward perfection.</p>

<p>That is why a Christian doctrine would make higher
demands than those embodied in the commandments,
and not in the least decrease its demands, as they who
judge the Christian doctrine from a social life-conception
seem to think.</p>

<p>This is one of the mistakes of the scientists in regard
to the significance of Christ's doctrine. And the substitution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of the love of humanity for the love and service
of God is another, and it springs from the same source.</p>

<p>In the Christian doctrine of loving and of serving
God, and (as the natural consequence of such love and
service) of loving and serving one's neighbor, there
seems to the scientific mind a certain mysticism, something
at once confused and arbitrary; and, believing
that the doctrine of love for humanity rests on a firmer
basis and is altogether more intelligible, they utterly
reject the requirement of love and service of God.</p>

<p>The theory of a scientist is that a virtuous life, a life
with a purpose, must be useful to the world at large;
and in a life of this kind they discover the solution of
the Christian doctrine, to which they reduce Christianity
itself. Assuming their own doctrine to be identical with
that of Christianity, they seek and believe that they find
in the latter an affirmation of their own views.</p>

<p>This is a fallacy. The Christian doctrine, and the
doctrine of the Positivists, and of all advocates of the
universal brotherhood of man, founded on the utility of
such a brotherhood, have nothing in common, and
especially do they differ in that the doctrine of Christianity
has a solid and a clearly defined foundation in
the human soul, whereas love of humanity is but a
theoretical conclusion reached through analogy.</p>

<p>The doctrine of the love of humanity has for its basis
the social life-conception.</p>

<p>The essence of the social life-conception consists in
replacing the sense of individual life by that of the life
of the group. In its first steps, this is a simple and
natural progression, as from the family to the tribe;
from the family to the race is more difficult, and requires
special education,&mdash;which has arrived at its utmost
limits when the State has been reached.</p>

<p>It is natural for every man to love himself, and he
needs no incentive thereto; to love his tribe, which lends
both support and protection; to love his wife, the delight
and comfort of his daily life; the children, who
are his consolation and his future hope; his parents,
who gave him life and cherished him,&mdash;all this, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
not so intense as love of self, is natural and
common to mankind.</p>

<p>To love one's race, one's people, for their own sake,
although not so instinctive, is also common. To love
one's ancestors, one's kinsfolk, through pride, is also
natural and frequent; and a man may feel love for his
fellow-countrymen, who speak the same language and
profess the same faith as himself, although the emotion
is less strong than love of self or love of family. But
love for a nation, Turkey, for instance, or Germany,
England, Austria, Russia, is almost impossible, and notwithstanding
the training given in that direction, it is
only a fictitious semblance; it has no real existence.
At this aggregate ceases man's power of transfusing his
innermost consciousness; for such a fiction he can feel
no direct sentiment. And yet the Positivists and all the
preachers of the scientific fraternity, not taking into
consideration the fact that this feeling is weakened in
proportion to the expansion of its object, continue to
theorize on the same lines. They say: "If it were
to the advantage of an individual to transfuse his consciousness
into the family, and thence into the nation
and the State, it follows that it will be to his further
advantage to transfuse his consciousness into the universal
entity, mankind, that all men may live for humanity,
as they have lived for the family and for the State."</p>

<p>And theoretically they are right.</p>

<p>After having transferred the consciousness and love
for the individual to the family, and from the family to
the race, the nation, and the State, it would be perfectly
logical for men, in order to escape the strife and disasters
that result from the division of mankind into
nations and states, to transfer their love to humanity at
large. This would appear to be the logical outcome,
and it has been offered as a theory by those who forget
that love is an innate sentiment, which can never be
inspired by preaching; that it must have a real object,
and that the entity which men call humanity is not a
real object, but a fiction.</p>

<p>A family, a race, even a State, are no inventions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
men; these things have formed themselves like a hive
of bees, or a colony of ants, and possess an actual existence.
The man who loves his family, after a human
fashion, knows whom he is loving&mdash;Ann, Maria, John,
or Peter. The man who loves his ancestors, and is
proud of them, knows that he loves the Guelphs, for
instance, or the Ghibellines; the man who loves his
country knows that he loves France from the Rhine to
the Pyrenees, that he loves its capital, Paris, and all its
history. But the man who loves humanity, what is it
that he loves? There is a State, there is a people, there
is the abstract conception of man. But humanity as a
concrete conception is impossible.</p>

<p>Humanity? Where is its limit? Where does it end
and where does it begin? Does it exclude the savage,
the idiot, the inebriate, the insane? If one were to draw
a line of demarcation so as to exclude the lower representatives
of the human race, where ought it to be
drawn? Ought it to exclude the Negro, as they do in
the United States, or the Hindoos, as some Englishmen
do, or the Jews, as does another nation? But if we
include all humanity without exception, why should we
restrict ourselves to men? Why should we exclude the
higher animals, some of whom are superior to the lowest
representatives of the human race?</p>

<p>We do not know humanity in the concrete, nor can
we fix its limits. Humanity is a fiction, and therefore
it cannot be loved. Indeed, it would be advantageous
if men could love humanity as they love the family. It
would be very useful, as the communists say, to substitute
a community of interests for individual competition,
or the universal for the personal; in a word, to make
the whole world a mutual benefit society,&mdash;only that
there are no motives to bring about such a result. The
Positivists, communists, and all the exponents of the
scientific fraternity exhort us to extend the love which
men feel for themselves, their families, their fellow-countrymen,
over humanity at large, forgetting that the
love of which they speak is a personal love, which may
be kindled for the family, and even extend to include<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
one's native country, but which expires altogether when
it is appealed to in behalf of an artificial state, such as
Austria, England, or Turkey; and when claimed for
that mystical object, humanity in general, one cannot
even grasp the idea.</p>

<p>"A man loves himself, his physical personality, he
loves his family, he even loves his country. Why
should he not also love mankind? It would seem such
a happy consummation! And it so happens that Christianity
inculcates the same precept." These are the
opinions of the Positivist, the communist, and the socialist
fraternities.</p>

<p>It would indeed be fortunate, but it is impossible,
because love founded on a personal and social life-conception
can go no further than the love of country.</p>

<p>The flaw in the argument arises from the fact that
the social life-conception, the basis of family love and of
patriotism, is itself an individual love, and such a love,
in its transference from a person to a family, a race, a
nation, and a State, gradually loses its efficiency, and in
the State has reached its final limit, and can go no
further.</p>

<p>The necessity for widening the sphere of love is not
to be denied, and yet it is the very attempt to satisfy
this requirement that destroys its possibility, and proves
the inadequacy of personal human love.</p>

<p>And here it is that the advocates of the Positivist,
communist, and socialist brotherhood offer as a prop to
the humanitarianism that has proved its inefficiency, a
Christian love, not in its essence, but only in its results;
in other words, not the love of God, but the love of
man.</p>

<p>But there can be no such love; it has no <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raison
d'étre</i>. Christian love comes only from a Christian life-conception,
whose sole manifestation is the love and
service of God.</p>

<p>By a natural sequence in the extension of love from
the individual to the family, and thence to the race, the
nation, and the State, the social life-conception has
brought men not to the consciousness of love for humanity,&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
is illimitable&mdash;the unification of every
living creature,&mdash;but to a condition which evokes no
feeling in man, to a contradiction for which it provides
no reconciliation.</p>

<p>It is only the Christian doctrine which, by lending to
human life a new significance, is able to solve the difficulty.
Christianity presents the love of self and the
love of the family, as well as patriotism and the love
of humanity, but it is not to be restricted to humanity
alone; it is to be given to every living creature; it
recognizes the possibility of an indefinite expansion of
the kingdom of love, but its object is not to be found
outside itself, in the aggregate of individuals, neither in
the family, nor in the race, nor in the State, nor in mankind,
nor all the wide world, but in itself, in its personality,&mdash;a
divine personality, whose essence is the very
love which needed a wider sphere.</p>

<p>The distinction between the Christian doctrine and
those which preceded it may be thus defined. The
social doctrine says: Curb thy nature (meaning the animal
nature alone); subject it to the visible law of the
family, of society, and of the State. Christianity says:
Live up to thy nature (meaning the divine nature);
make it subject to nothing; neither to thine own animal
nature, nor to that of another, and then thou shalt attain
what thou seekest by subjecting thine outward personality
to visible laws. The Christian doctrine restores to
man his original consciousness of self, not the animal
self, but the godlike self, the spark of divinity, as the
son of God, like unto the Father, but clothed in a human
form. This consciousness of one's self as a son
of God, whose essence is love, satisfies at once all those
demands made by the man who professes the social life-conception
for a broader sphere of love. Again, in the
social life-conception the enlargement of the domain of
love was a necessity for the salvation of the individual;
it was attached to certain objects, to one's self, to one's
family, to society, and to humanity. With the Christian
world-conception love is not a necessity, neither is it
attached to any special object; it is the inherent quality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
of a man's soul; he loves because he cannot help
loving.</p>

<p>The Christian doctrine teaches to man that the essence
of his soul is love; that his well-being may be traced,
not to the fact that he loves this object or that one, but
to the fact that he loves the principle of all things&mdash;God,
whom he recognizes in himself through love, and
will by the love of God love all men and all things.</p>

<p>This is the essential difference between the Christian
doctrine and that of the Positivists, and all other non-Christian
theorists of a universal brotherhood.</p>

<p>Such are the two chief misapprehensions in regard to
the Christian doctrine, and from those most of the false
arguments on the subject have originated.</p>

<p>One is, that the doctrine of Christ, like the doctrines
which preceded it, promulgates rules which men must
obey, and that these rules are impracticable. The other,
that the whole meaning of Christianity is contained in
the doctrine of a coöperative union of mankind, in one
family, to attain which, leaving aside the question of
love of God, one should obey only the rule of love of
one's fellow-men.</p>

<p>Finally, the mistake of scientists, in supposing that
the doctrine of the supernatural contains the essence of
Christianity, that its life-teaching is not practicable,
together with the general misapprehensions that result
from such a misconception, further explains why men
of our time have so misunderstood Christianity.</p>

<h3>CONTRADICTION OF OUR LIFE AND CHRISTIAN
CONSCIOUSNESS</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Men consider that they may accept Christianity without changing their
life&mdash;The pagan life-conception no longer corresponds to the present
age of humanity, which the Christian life-conception alone can satisfy&mdash;The
Christian life-conception is still misunderstood by men, but our
life itself necessitates its acceptance&mdash;The requirements of a new life-conception
always seem unintelligible, mystical, and supernatural&mdash;Such,
for the majority of men, seem the requirements of the Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
life-conception&mdash;The acceptance of a Christian life-conception will inevitably
be accomplished both through spiritual and material agencies&mdash;The
fact that men, conscious of a higher life-conception, continue to
entertain the lower forms of life, causes contradiction and suffering,
which embitter life and require its alteration&mdash;Contradictions of our
life&mdash;The economical contradiction, and the suffering it causes to the
working-men and to the rich&mdash;The contradiction of State, and the
sufferings that arise from obedience to State laws&mdash;The international
contradiction, and its acknowledgment by contemporary writers:
Komarvosky, Ferri, Booth, Passy, Lawson, Wilson, Bartlett, Defourny,
Moneta&mdash;The military contradiction the extreme.</p></blockquote>


<p>Many causes have contributed toward the misunderstanding
of the teaching of Christ. One of these is that
men assumed to understand the doctrine, when, like the
faithful of the Church, they accepted the statement that
it had been transmitted in a supernatural manner; or,
like the scientists, after having investigated certain of its
outward manifestations. Another reason may be found
in the conviction that it is impracticable, and that it may
be replaced by the doctrine of love of humanity. But
the principal reason of all such misconceptions is that
men look upon the doctrine of Christ as one that may
be accepted or rejected without any special change in
one's life.</p>

<p>Men, attached by habit to the existing order, shrink
from attempting to change it, hence they agree to consider
this doctrine as a mass of revelations and laws that
may be accepted without making any change in one's
life: whereas the doctrine of Christ is not a doctrine of
rules for man to obey, but unfolds a new life-conception,
meant as a guide for men who are now entering upon a
new period, one entirely different from the past.</p>

<p>The life of humanity continues its course and has its
stages, like the life of an individual; each age has its
own life-conception, which a man must adopt whether
he will or no. Those who do not adopt it consciously,
adopt it unconsciously. The same change that takes
place in the views of the individual, as life goes on,
occurs also in the existence of nations and of humanity
in general.</p>

<p>If a father were to conduct his affairs like a child, his
life would certainly become so unbearable that he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
cast about for a different plan of life, and would eagerly
grasp at one better suited to his years.</p>

<p>And the human race is at the present time passing
through a similar experience, in its transition from a
pagan to a Christian life-conception. A man of the
society of the present day finds that the pagan life-conception
is no longer suited to the times, hence he is
induced to submit to the requirements of the Christian
religion, whose truths, however misunderstood and
falsely interpreted they may be, are yet familiar to his
ears, and seem to offer the only practical solution of the
contradictions that beset his path. If the demands of
the Christian doctrine seem unintelligible, peculiar, and
dangerous to a man who has hitherto held the social
life-conception, the demands of the latter seemed none
the less so to a savage of a previous age, who neither
fully apprehended them, nor was able to foresee their
consequences.</p>

<p>The savage reasoned thus: "It would be folly for me
to sacrifice my peace or my life to defend an incomprehensible,
intangible, and uncertain ideal, family, race,
country, and, above all, it would be dangerous to deliver
myself into the hands of an unknown power." But there
came a time in the life of the savage when, on the one
hand, he had begun, although vaguely, to understand the
meaning of social life, as well as that of its chief incentive,&mdash;social
approval or condemnation: glory,&mdash;while,
on the other hand, the sufferings of his personal life
had become so severe that it was no longer possible for
him to go on believing in the truth of his former life-conception;
whereupon he accepted the social and State
doctrine and submitted to its laws.</p>

<p>And he who holds the social life-conception is now
undergoing a similar experience.</p>

<p>"It is madness"&mdash;thus reasons the man holding
such views&mdash;"to sacrifice one's interests or those of
one's family and of one's country, in order to fulfil the
requirements of a law that would compel one to renounce
the most natural and praiseworthy feelings
toward one's self, one's family, and one's country, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
above all, the guarantee of protection afforded by the
State."</p>

<p>But there comes a time when, on the one hand, a
vague awakening consciousness stirs the soul, the consciousness
of the higher law, love of God and one's
neighbor, and the sufferings a man endures from the
contradictions of life, compel him to renounce the social
life-conception and to adopt the new Christian life-conception
which is offered him. And this time has now
arrived.</p>

<p>To us, who underwent the transition from the individual
to the social life-conception thousands of years
ago, this transition appears to have been both natural
and inevitable, just as the present transition, through
which we have been passing these last 1800 years, seems
arbitrary, unnatural, and overwhelming. But it seems so
for the simple reason that the former change is a thing
of the past, and has fixed in us certain habits, whereas
we are still practically accomplishing the present transition,
and have to accomplish it consciously.</p>

<p>It was centuries, indeed thousands of years, before the
social life-conception was adopted by all mankind; it
passed through various phases, and we ourselves possess
it through heredity, education, and unconscious habit;
hence it seems natural to us. But 5000 years ago it
seemed as strange and unnatural to men as the Christian
doctrine in its true meaning seems to them now.</p>

<p>The universal brotherhood of man, the equality of
races, the abolition of property, the anomalous doctrine
of non-resistance, all these requirements of the Christian
religion seem to us impossibilities. But in olden times,
thousands of years ago, not only the requirements of
the State, but even those of the family, as, for instance,
the obligation of parents to feed their children, of children
to support their aged parents, and that of conjugal
fidelity, seemed equally impossible. And still more unreasonable
seemed the demands of the State, requiring
citizens to submit to established authority, to pay taxes,
to perform military duty in defense of their country,
etc. We find no difficulty in comprehending these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
requirements now; they seem perfectly simple and
natural, with nothing mystical or alarming in their aspect;
but five or even three thousand years ago, such
demands seemed intolerable.</p>

<p>Thus the social life-conception served as a foundation
for religion, for at the time when it was first manifested
to men it seemed to them to be utterly incomprehensible,
mystical, and supernatural. Now that we have
passed that phase of human life, we can understand the
reasons for the aggregation of men into families, communities,
and states. But in the early ages the demand
for these aggregations was made in the name of the
supernatural, and its fulfilment assured by the same
authority.</p>

<p>The patriarchal religion deified the family, the race,
the people. State religions deified the sovereigns and
the State. Even at the present day the uneducated
masses, the Russian peasants, for instance, who call the
Czar a God upon earth, obey the laws from religious
instinct, not because their reason counsels them to do
so, nor because they have the least idea of a State.</p>

<p>And to those men of our own times who hold the
social life-conception, the Christian doctrine seems to be
a supernatural religion, whereas in reality there is nothing
mystical or supernatural about it; it is only a doctrine
concerning human life, corresponding with the
degree of development which man has attained, and
one which he cannot refuse to accept.</p>

<p>The time will come, and it is already near at hand,
when the Christian foundations of life&mdash;equality, brotherly
love, community of goods, non-resistance of evil by
violence&mdash;will seem as natural and simple as the foundations
of family, social, and State life appear to us at
the present time.</p>

<p>There can be no retrogression for humanity. Men
have outgrown the lower life-conception of the family
and the State, and must press forward to embrace the
next higher conception, as they have already begun
to do.</p>

<p>This movement is accomplished in two ways: consciously,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
by moral causes; unconsciously, by material
ones. It rarely happens that a man changes his mode
of life at the dictates of reason; however conscious he
may be of the new design and purpose revealed to him
by his reason, he goes on in the old fashion until his life
has become intolerably inconsistent, and therefore distressing.
Likewise, the larger portion of mankind, after
learning through its religious teachers a new conception
of life and its objects, to which it has yet to adjust itself,
will for a long time pursue its wonted course, and only
make the change in the end because its former life has
become impossible.</p>

<p>In spite of the necessity for a change of life, acknowledged
and proclaimed by our religious guides and admitted
by the wisest men, in spite of the religious
respect entertained for these guides, the majority of
men continue to be influenced in life, now additionally
complicated, by their former views. It is as if the father
of a family, knowing well enough how to conduct himself
properly, should through force of habit or thoughtlessness
continue to live as if he were still a child.</p>

<p>At this very moment we are experiencing one of these
transitions. Humanity has outgrown its social, its civic
age, and has entered upon a new epoch. It knows the
doctrine that must underlie the foundations of life in this
new epoch; but, yielding to inertia, it still clings to its
former habits. From this inconsistency between the
theory of life and its practice follow a series of contradictions
and sufferings that embitter man's life and compel
him to make a change.</p>

<p>One needs but to compare the practice of life with its
theory to be horrified at the extraordinary contradictions
between the conditions of life and our inner consciousness.</p>

<p>Man's whole life is a continual contradiction of what
he knows to be his duty. This contradiction prevails in
every department of life, in the economical, the political,
and the international. As though his intelligence were
forgotten and his faith temporarily eclipsed,&mdash;for he
must have faith, else would his life have no permanence,&mdash;he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
acts in direct opposition to the dictates of
his conscience and his common sense.</p>

<p>In our economical and international relations we are
guided by the fundamental principles of bygone ages,&mdash;principles
quite contradictory to our mental attitude
and the conditions of our present life.</p>

<p>It was right for a man who believed in the divine
origin of slavery, and in its necessity, to live in the
relation of a master to his slaves. But is such a life
possible in these days? A man of antiquity might
believe himself justified in taking advantage of his
fellow-man, oppressing him for generations, merely because
he believed in diversity of origin, noble or base,
descent from Ham or Japheth. Not only have the
greatest philosophers of ancient times, the teachers of
mankind, Plato and Aristotle, justified the existence of
slavery and adduced proofs of its legality, but no longer
than three centuries ago those who described an ideal
state of society could not picture it without slaves.</p>

<p>In ancient times, and even in the Middle Ages, it
was honestly thought that men were not born equal,
that the men worthy of respect were only Persians,
only Greeks, only Romans, or only Frenchmen; but no
one believes it now. And the enthusiastic advocates
of the principles of aristocracy and patriotism at this
present day cannot believe in their own statements.</p>

<p>We all know, and cannot help knowing, even if we
had never heard it defined and never attempted to
define it ourselves, that we all possess an inherent conviction
deep in our hearts of the truth of that fundamental
doctrine of Christianity, that we are all children
of one Father, yea, every one of us, wheresoever we
may live, whatsoever language we may speak; that we
are all brothers, subject only to the law of love implanted
in our hearts by our common Father.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the habits of thought or the degree
of education of a man of our time, whether he be an
educated liberal, whatsoever his shade of opinion, a
philosopher, whatsoever may be his system, a scientist,
an economist of any of the various schools, an uneducated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
adherent of any religious faith,&mdash;every man in
these days knows that in the matter of life and worldly
goods all men have equal rights; that no man is either
better or worse than his fellow-men, but that all men
are born free and equal. Every man has an instinctive
assurance of this fact, and yet he sees his fellow-beings
divided into two classes, the one in poverty and
distress, which labors and is oppressed, the other idle,
tyrannical, luxurious; and not only does he see all this,
but, whether voluntarily or otherwise, he falls in line
with one or the other of these divisions,&mdash;a course
repugnant to his reason. Hence he must suffer both
from his sense of the incongruity and his own share
in it.</p>

<p>Whether he be master or slave, a man in these days
is forever haunted by this distressing inconsistency
between his ideal and the actual fact, nor can he fail
to perceive the suffering that springs therefrom.</p>

<p>The masses&mdash;that is to say, the majority of mankind,
who suffer and toil, their lives dull and uninteresting,
never enlivened by a ray of brightness, enduring
numberless privations&mdash;are those who recognize most
clearly the sharp contrasts between what is and what
ought to be, between the professions of mankind and
their actions.</p>

<p>They know that they work like slaves, that they are
perishing in want and in darkness, that they may minister
to the pleasures of the minority. And it is this
very consciousness that enhances its bitterness; indeed,
it constitutes the essence of their suffering.</p>

<p>A slave in old times knew that he was a slave by
birth, whereas the working-man of our day, while he
feels himself to be a slave, knows that he ought not
to be one, and suffers the tortures of Tantalus from
his unsatisfied yearning for that which not only could
be granted him, but which is really his due. The sufferings
of the working-classes that spring from the
contradictions of their fate are magnified tenfold by
the envy and hatred which are the natural fruits of the
sense of these contradictions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>A working-man in our period, even though his work
may be less fatiguing than the labor of the ancient
slave, and even were he to succeed in obtaining the
eight-hour system and twelve-and-sixpence a day, still
has the worst of it, because he manufactures objects
which he will never use or enjoy;&mdash;he is not working
for himself; he works in order to gratify the luxurious
and idle, to increase the wealth of the capitalist, the
mill-owner, or manufacturer. He knows that all this
goes on in a world where men acknowledge certain
propositions such as the economic principle that labor
is wealth, that it is an act of injustice to employ another
man's labor for one's own benefit, that an illegal act is
punishable by law, in a world, moreover, where the
doctrine of Christ is professed,&mdash;that doctrine which
teaches us that all men are brothers, and that it is the
duty of a man to serve his neighbor and to take no
unfair advantage of him.</p>

<p>He realizes all this, and must suffer keenly from the
shocking contradiction between the world as it should
be and the world as it is. "According to what I am
told and what I hear men profess," says a working-man
to himself, "I ought to be a free man equal to any other
man, and loved; I am a slave, hated and despised."
Then he in his turn is filled with hatred, and seeks to
escape from his position, to overthrow the enemy that
oppresses him, and to get the upper hand himself.</p>

<p>They say: "It is wrong for a workman to wish himself
in the place of a capitalist, or for a poor man to
envy the rich." But this is false. If this were a world
where God had ordained masters and slaves, rich and
poor, it would be wrong for the working-man or the
poor man to wish himself in the place of the rich: but
this is not so; he wishes it in a world which professes
the doctrine of the gospel, whose first principle is embodied
in the relation of the son to the Father, and
consequently of fraternity and equality. And however
reluctant men may be to acknowledge it, they cannot
deny that one of the first conditions of Christian life is
love, expressed, not in words, but in deeds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>The man of education suffers even more from these
inconsistencies. If he has any faith whatever he believes,
perhaps, in fraternity,&mdash;at least in the sentiment
humanity; and if not in the sentiment humanity, then
in justice; and if not in justice, then surely in science;
and he cannot help knowing all the while that the conditions
of his life are opposed to every principle of
Christianity, humanity, justice, and science.</p>

<p>He knows that the habits of life in which he has
been bred, and whose abandonment would cause him
much discomfort, can only be supported by the weary
and often suicidal labor of the down-trodden working-class&mdash;that
is, by the open infraction of those principles
of Christianity, humanity, justice, and even of science
(political science), in which he professes to believe. He
affirms his faith in the principles of fraternity, humanity,
justice, and political science, and yet the oppression of
the working-class is an indispensable factor in his daily
life, and he constantly employs it to attain his own ends
in spite of his principles; and he not only lives in this
manner, but he devotes all his energies to maintain a
system which is directly opposed to all his beliefs.</p>

<p>We are brothers: but every morning my brother or
my sister performs for me the most menial offices.
We are brothers: but I must have my morning cigar,
my sugar, my mirror, or what not,&mdash;objects whose
manufacture has often cost my brothers and sisters
their health, yet I do not for that reason forbear to use
these things; on the contrary, I even demand them.
We are brothers: and yet I support myself by working
in some bank, commercial house, or shop, and am always
trying to raise the price of the necessities of life for my
brothers and sisters. We are brothers: I receive a
salary for judging, convicting, and punishing the thief
or the prostitute, whose existence is the natural outcome
of my own system of life, and I fully realize that I
should neither condemn nor punish. We are all brothers:
yet I make my living by collecting taxes from the poor,
that the rich may live in luxury and idleness. We are
brothers: and yet I receive a salary for preaching a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
pseudo-Christian doctrine, in which I do not myself believe,
thus hindering men from discovering the true
one; I receive a salary as priest or bishop for deceiving
people in a matter which is of vital importance to
them. We are brothers: but I make my brother pay
for all my services, whether I write books for him,
educate him, or prescribe for him as a physician. We
are all brothers: but I receive a salary for fitting myself
to be a murderer, for learning the art of war, or for
manufacturing arms and ammunition and building
fortresses.</p>

<p>The whole existence of our upper classes is utterly
contradictory, and the more sensitive a man's nature the
more painful is the incongruity.</p>

<p>A man with a sensitive conscience can enjoy no peace
of mind in such a life. Even supposing that he succeeds
in stifling the reproaches of his conscience, he is
still unable to conquer his fears.</p>

<p>Those men and women of the dominant classes who
have hardened themselves, and have succeeded in stifling
their consciences, must still suffer through their fear of
the hatred they inspire. They are quite well aware
of its existence among the laboring classes; they know
that it can never die; they know, too, that the working-men
realize the deceits practised upon them, and the
abuses that they endure; that they have started organizations
to throw off the yoke, and to take vengeance on
their oppressors. The happiness of the upper classes
is poisoned by fear of the impending calamity, foreshadowed
by the unions, the strikes, and First of May
demonstrations. Recognizing the calamity that threatens
them, their fear turns to defiance and hatred. They
know that if they relax for one moment in this conflict
with the oppressed, they are lost, because their slaves,
already embittered, grow more and more so with every
day's oppression. The oppressors, though they may
see it, cannot cease to oppress. They realize that they
themselves are doomed from the moment they abate
one jot of their severity. So they go on in their career
of oppression, notwithstanding their affectation of interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
in the welfare of the working-men, the eight-hour
system, the laws restricting the labor of women and
children, the pensions, and the rewards. All this is
mere pretense, or at best the natural anxiety of the
master to keep his slave in good condition; but the
slave remains a slave all the while, and the master, who
cannot live without the slave, is less willing than ever to
set him free. The governing classes find themselves
in regard to the working-men very much in the position
of one who has overthrown his opponent, and who holds
him down, not so much because he does not choose to
let him escape, but because he knows that should he for
one moment lose his hold on him, he would lose his own
life, for the vanquished man is infuriated, and holds a
knife in his hand.</p>

<p>Hence our wealthy classes, whether their consciences
be tender or hardened, cannot enjoy the advantages
they have wrung from the poor, as did the ancients,
who were convinced of the justice of their position. All
the pleasures of life are poisoned either by remorse or
fear.</p>

<p>Such is the economic inconsistency. Still more striking
is that of the civil power.</p>

<p>A man is trained first of all in habits of obedience to
state laws. At the present time every act of our lives
is under the supervision of the State, and in accordance
with its dictates a man marries and is divorced, rears his
children, and in some countries accepts the religion it
prescribes. What is this law, then, that determines the
life of mankind? Do men believe in it? Do they consider
it true? Not at all. In most cases they recognize
its injustice, they despise it, and yet they obey it. It
was fit that the ancients should obey their law. It
was chiefly religious, and they sincerely believed it to
be the only true law, to which all men owed obedience.
Is that the case with us? We cannot refuse to acknowledge
that the law of our State is not the eternal law,
but only one of the many laws of many states, all equally
imperfect, and frequently wholly false and unjust,&mdash;a
law that has been openly discussed in all its aspects by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the public press. It was fit that the Hebrew should obey
his laws, since he never doubted that the finger of God
Himself had traced them; or for the Roman, who believed
that he received them from the nymph Egeria;
or even for those peoples who believed that the rulers who
made the laws were anointed of God, or that legislative
assemblies have both the will and the ability to
devise laws as good as possible. But we know that
laws are the offspring of party conflicts, false dealing,
and the greed of gain, that they are not, and can never
be, the depository of true justice; and therefore it is
impossible for people of the present day to believe that
obedience to civil or state laws can ever satisfy the
rational demands of human nature. Men have long
since realized that there is no sense in obeying a law
whose honesty is more than doubtful, and therefore they
must suffer when, though privately denying its prerogative,
they still conform to it. When a man's whole life
is held in bondage by laws whose injustice, cruelty, and
artificiality he plainly discerns, and yet is compelled to
obey these laws under penalty of punishment, he must
suffer; it cannot be otherwise.</p>

<p>We recognize the disadvantages of custom-houses and
import duties, but we are yet obliged to pay them; we
see the folly of supporting the court and its numerous
officials, we admit the harmful influence of church preaching,
and still we are compelled to support both; we also
admit the cruel and iniquitous punishments inflicted by
the courts, and yet we play our part in them; we acknowledge
that the distribution of land is wrong and
immoral, but we have to submit to it; and despite the
fact that we deny the necessity for armies or warfare,
we are made to bear the heavy burden of supporting
armies and waging war.</p>

<p>These contradictions, however, are but trifling in comparison
with the one which confronts us in the problem
of our international relations, and which cries aloud for
solution, since both human reason and human life are
at stake, and this is the antagonism between the Christian
faith and war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>We, Christian nations, whose spiritual life is one and
the same, who welcome the birth of every wholesome
and profitable thought with joy and pride, from whatsoever
quarter of the globe it may spring, regardless
of race or creed; we, who love not only the philanthropists,
the poets, the philosophers, and the scientists of
other lands; we, who take as much pride in the heroism
of a Father Damien as if it was our own; we, who love
the French, the Germans, the Americans, and the English,
not only esteeming their qualities, but ready to
meet them with cordial friendship; we, who not only
would be shocked to consider war with them in the light
of an exploit,&mdash;when we picture to ourselves the possibility
that at some future day a difference may arise
between us that can only be reconciled by murder, and
that any one of us may be called upon to play his part
in an inevitable tragedy,&mdash;we shudder at the thought.</p>

<p>It was well enough for a Hebrew, a Greek, or a Roman
to maintain the independence of his country by murder,
and even to subdue other nations by the same means,
because he firmly believed himself a member of the one
favored people beloved by God, and that all the others
were Philistines and barbarians. Also, in the times of
the Middle Ages men might well have held these opinions,
and even they who lived toward the end of the last
century and at the beginning of this. But we, whatever
provocation may be offered us, we cannot possibly believe
as they did; and this difficulty is so painful for us in these
times that it has become impossible to live without
trying to solve it.</p>

<p>"We live in a time replete with contradictions," writes
Count Komarovsky, the Professor of International Law,
in his learned treatise. "Everywhere the tone of the
public press seems to indicate a general desire for peace,
and shows the need of it for all nations. And the representatives
of the government, in their private as well
as in their public capacity, in parliamentary speeches
and diplomatic negotiations, express themselves in the
same temper. Nevertheless, the governments increase
the military force year after year, impose new taxes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
negotiate loans, and will leave as a legacy to future
generations the responsibilities of the present mistaken
policy. How are the word and the deed at variance!</p>

<p>"By way of justification the governments claim that
all their armaments and the consequent outlay are simply
defensive in their character, but to the uninitiated the
question naturally suggests itself: Whence is to come
the attack if all the great powers are devoting themselves
<em>to a defensive policy</em>? It certainly looks as if
each one of them lived in hourly expectation of attack
from his neighbor, and the consequence is a strife between
the different governments to surpass each other
in strength. The very existence of this spirit of rivalry
favors the chances of war: the nations, no longer able
to support the increased armament, will sooner or later
prefer open war to the tension in which they live and
the ruin which menaces them, so that the slightest pretext
will avail to kindle in Europe the conflagration of
a general war. It is a mistake to suppose that such
a crisis will heal the political and economic ills under
which we groan. The experience of late wars shows
us that each one served only to exacerbate the animosity
of the nations against each other, to increase the unbearable
burden of military despotism, and has involved
the political and economic situation of Europe in a more
melancholy and pitiable plight than ever."</p>

<p>"Contemporary Europe keeps under arms nine millions
of men," says Enrico Ferri, "and a reserve force of fifteen
millions, at a cost of four milliards of francs a year. By
increasing its armament it paralyzes more and more the
springs of social and individual welfare, and may be compared
to a man who, in order to obtain weapons, condemns
himself to anæmia, thereby depriving himself of
the strength to use the weapons he is accumulating,
whose weight will eventually overpower him."</p>

<p>The same idea has been expressed by Charles Booth,
in his address delivered in London, July 26, 1887, before
the Association for the Reform and Codification of National
Laws. Having mentioned the same numbers,&mdash;over
nine millions in active service and fifteen millions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
in reserve, and the enormous sums required to support
these armies and armaments,&mdash;he says, in substance:
"These numbers represent but a small part of the actual
expenditure, because outside of the expenses enumerated
in the budgets of the nations we must take into consideration
the great losses to society from the removal of so
many able-bodied men, lost to industry in all its branches,
and moreover, the interest on the enormous sums spent
in military preparations, which yield no returns. As
might be expected, the constantly increasing national
debts are the inevitable result of these outlays in preparation
for war. By far the greater proportion of the
debt of Europe has been contracted for munitions of
war. The sum total is four milliards of pounds, or forty
milliards of roubles, and these debts are increasing every
year."</p>

<p>Komarovsky, whom we lately quoted, says elsewhere:
"We are living in hard times. Everywhere we hear complaints
of the stagnation of commerce and industry, and
of the wretched economical situation. They tell us of
the hard conditions of life among the laboring classes
and the general impoverishment of the people. But regardless
of this, governments, determined to maintain
their independence, go to the utmost limits of folly.
Additional taxes are levied on every side, and the financial
oppression of the people knows no bounds. If we
glance at the budgets of European states for the last
hundred years, we shall be struck with their constantly
increasing figures. How can we explain this abnormal
condition that sooner or later threatens to overwhelm
us with inevitable bankruptcy?</p>

<p>"Most assuredly it is caused by the expense of maintaining
armies, which absorbs one-third, or even one-half,
of the budget of all European nations. The saddest part
of it, however, is that there is no end to this increase of
budgets and consequent impoverishment of the masses.
What is socialism but a protest against the abnormal situation
in which the majority of mankind of our continent
finds itself?"</p>

<p>"We are being ruined," says Frédéric Passy, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
paper read before the last Peace Congress in London
(1890), "to enable us to take part in the senseless wars
of the future, or to pay the interest of debts left us by
the criminal and insane wars and contests of the past.
We shall perish with hunger, to have success in murder."</p>

<p>Going on to speak of the opinion of France in regard
to this matter, he says: "We believe that now, a hundred
years after the proclamation formulating the belief
in the rights of men and citizens, the time has come to
declare the rights of nations and to repudiate once and
for all time those undertakings of fraud and violence,
which, under the name of conquests, are actually crimes
against humanity, and which, however much the pride
of nations or the ambition of monarchs may seek to
justify them, serve only to enervate the conquerors."</p>

<p>"I am always very much surprised at the way religion
is carried on in this country," says Sir Wilfred Lawson
before the same Congress. "You send a boy to the
Sunday-school, and you tell him: 'My dear boy, you
must love your enemies; if any boy strikes you, don't
strike him again; try to reform him by loving him.'
Well, the boy goes to the Sunday-school till he is fourteen
or fifteen years of age, and then his friends say,
'Put him in the army.' What has he to do in the
army? Why, not love his enemies, but whenever he
sees an enemy, to run him through the body with a
bayonet is the nature of all religious teaching in this
country. I do not think that that is a very good way
of carrying out the precepts of religion. I think if it is
a good thing for the boy to love his enemy, it is a good
thing for the man to love his enemy."...</p>

<p>And later!</p>

<p>"In Europe great Christian nations keep among
them 28,000,000 of armed men to settle quarrels by killing
one another, instead of by arguing. This is what
the Christian nations of the world are doing at this
moment. It is a very expensive way also; for in a
publication which I saw&mdash;I believe it was correct&mdash;it
was made out that since the year 1812 these nations
had spent the almost incredible amount of 1,500,000,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
of money in preparing and settling their quarrels by
killing one another. Now it seems to me that with that
state of things one of two positions must be accepted,&mdash;either
that Christianity is a failure, or that those who
profess to expound Christianity have failed in expounding
it properly."</p>

<p>"So long as our men-of-war are not disarmed and our
army not disbanded, we have no right to be called a
Christian nation," said Mr. F. L. Wilson.</p>

<p>In a conversation in regard to the duty of Christian
ministers in the matter of preaching against war, Mr.
G. D. Bartlett remarked, among other things:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If I understand the Scriptures, I say that men are
only playing with Christianity when they ignore this
question.... I have lived a long life, I have heard
many sermons, and I can say without any exaggeration
that I never heard universal peace recommended from
the pulpit half a dozen times in my life.... Some
twenty years ago I happened to stand in a drawing-room
where there were forty or fifty people, and I dared to
make the proposition that war was incompatible with
Christianity. They looked upon me as an arrant fanatic.
The idea that we could get on without war was regarded
as unmitigated weakness and folly."</p>

<p>A Catholic priest, the Abbé Defourny, has spoken in
a similar spirit. "One of the first commandments of
the eternal law, engraved in every man's conscience,"
says the Abbé Defourny, "forbids a man to take his
neighbor's life or shed his blood" (without sufficient
cause, being forced to it by stress of circumstance).
"This is a commandment more deeply engraved in the
human heart than all the others.... But as soon as it becomes
a question of war, that is, a question of the wholesale
shedding of human blood, men in these days do not
wait for a sufficient cause. Those who are active in
war forget to ask themselves if there is any justification
for the numerous manslaughters that take place, whether
they are just or unjust, legal or illegal, innocent or criminal,
or whether they break the principal law that forbids
us to commit murder" (without just cause). "Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
conscience is silent.... War has ceased to be a matter
connected with morality. The soldier, amid all the
fatigues and dangers he undergoes, knows no joy but
conquest, no sorrow but defeat. Don't tell me that
they serve the country. A great genius has long ago
answered this statement in words that have since become
a proverb: 'Take away justice, and what is then a
nation but a great band of robbers? And is not a
band of robbers in itself a small state? They, too,
have their laws. They, too, fight for booty, and even
honor.'</p>

<p>"The aim of this organization" (it was a question of
establishing international tribunals) "is to influence the
European nations until they cease to be nations of thieves,
and their armies bands of robbers. Yes, our armies are
nothing less than a rabble of slaves belonging to one or
two monarchs and their ministers, who, as we all know,
rule them tyrannically and without any responsibility
other than nominal, as we know.</p>

<p>"It is the characteristic of a slave that he is a tool in
the hands of his master. Such are the soldiers, officers,
and generals, who at the beck of their sovereign go forth
to slay or to be slain. There is a military slavery, and
it is the worst of all slaveries, particularly now, when
by means of conscription it forges chains for the necks
of all the free and strong men of the nation, in order to
use them as instruments of murder, to make them executioners
and butchers of human flesh, since that is the
sole reason why they are drafted and drilled....</p>

<p>"Two or three potentates in their cabinets make
treaties, without protocols, without publicity, and therefore
without responsibility, sending men to the slaughter.</p>

<p>"'Protests against increased armaments began before
our time,' said Signor E. G. Moneta. Listen to Montesquieu:
'France' (for France we might now substitute
Europe) 'is perishing from an overgrown army. A new
disease is spreading throughout Europe. It has affected
kings, and obliges them to maintain an incredible number
of troops. It is like a rash, and therefore contagious;
for no sooner does one nation increase its troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
than all the others follow suit. Nothing can result from
this condition of affairs but general calamity.</p>

<p>"'Each government maintains as many troops as it
would require if its people were threatened with destruction,
and this state of tension is called peace. Europe
is in truth ruined. If private individuals were reduced
to such straits as these, the richest man among them
would be practically destitute. The wealth of the world
and its commerce are in our hands, and yet we are poor.'</p>

<p>"This was written almost 150 years ago. It seems
like a picture of the present. One thing alone has
changed&mdash;the form of government. In the time of
Montesquieu it was said that the reason for the maintenance
of large armies might be found in the unlimited
power of kings, who carried on war in the hope of increasing
their private property and their glory.</p>

<p>"Then it was said: 'Ah! if the people could but
choose representatives who would have a right to refuse
the governments when they called for soldiers and money&mdash;there
would be an end of a military policy.' Now,
almost everywhere in Europe there are representative
governments, and still the military expenditure in preparation
for war has increased in frightful proportion.</p>

<p>"It looks as though the folly of the rulers had passed
into the ruling classes. Now they no longer fight because
one king has been rude to another king's mistress,
as in the time of Louis XIV., but by exaggerating the
importance of national dignity and patriotism,&mdash;emotions
which are natural and honorable in themselves,&mdash;and
exciting the public opinion of one country against the
other, until they have arrived at such a pitch of sensitiveness
that it is enough to say, for instance (even were
the report to prove false), one country has refused to
receive the ambassador of another, to precipitate the
most frightful and disastrous war. Europe maintains
under arms at the present time more soldiers than were
in the field during the great wars of Napoleon. Every
citizen on our continent, with a few exceptions, is forced
to spend several years in the barracks. Fortresses,
arsenals, men-of-war are built, new firearms are invented,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
which in a short time are replaced by others, because
science, which should always be devoted to the promotion
of human welfare, contributes, it must be regretfully
acknowledged, to human destruction, inventing ever new
means of killing greater numbers of men in the shortest
possible time.</p>

<p>"In these stupendous preparations for slaughter, and
in the maintenance of these vast numbers of troops,
hundreds of millions are yearly expended&mdash;sums that
would suffice to educate the masses, and to carry on the
most important works of public improvement, thereby
contributing toward a perfect solution of the social
problem.</p>

<p>"Therefore, notwithstanding all our scientific victories,
Europe finds herself in this respect not one whit better
off than she was in the most barbarous times of the
Middle Ages. Every one laments a state of things which
is neither war nor peace, and longs to be delivered from
it. The heads of governments emphatically affirm that
they desire peace, and eagerly emulate each other in
their pacific utterances, but almost immediately thereafter
they propose to the legislative assemblies measures
for increasing the armament, asserting that they take
these precautions for the preservation of peace.</p>

<p>"But this is not the sort of peace we care for, and the
nations are not deceived by it. True peace has for its
foundation mutual confidence, whereas these appalling
armaments show, if not a declared hostility, at least a
secret distrust among the different nations. What should
we say of a man who, wishing to show his friendly feelings
to his neighbor, should invite him to consider a
certain scheme, holding a loaded pistol while he unfolds
it before him?</p>

<p>"It is this monstrous contradiction between the assurances
of peace and the military policy of the governments,
that good citizens wish to put an end to, at any
cost."</p>

<p>One is amazed to learn that there are 60,000 suicides
reported in Europe, not including Turkey and Russia,
every year, and these are all well-substantiated cases;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
but it would be far more remarkable if the number were
less. Any man in these times who investigates the
antagonism between his convictions and his actions,
finds himself in a desperate plight. Setting aside the
many other contradictions between actual life and
conviction which abound in the life of a man of the
present day, to view the military situation in Europe in
the light of its profession of Christianity is enough to
make a man doubt the existence of human reason, and
drive him to escape from a barbarous and insane world
by putting an end to his own life. This inconsistency,
which is the very quintessence of all the others, is so
shocking, that one can only go on living and taking
any part in it, by dint of trying not to think about it,&mdash;to
forget it all.</p>

<p>What can it mean? We are Christians, who not only
profess to love one another, but are actually leading one
common life; our pulses beat in harmony; we meet
each other in love and sympathy, deriving support and
counsel from our mutual intercourse. Were it not for
this sympathy life would have no meaning. But at any
moment some demented ruler may utter a few rash
words, to which another gives reply, and lo! I am
ordered to march at the risk of my life, to slay those
who have never injured me, whom I really love. And
it is no remote contingency, but an inevitable climax for
which we are all preparing ourselves.</p>

<p>Fully to realize this is enough to drive one to madness
and to suicide, and this is but too common an occurrence,
especially among soldiers.</p>

<p>A moment's reflection shows us why this seems an
inevitable conclusion.</p>

<p>It explains the frightful intensity with which men
plunge into all kinds of dissipation,&mdash;wine, tobacco, cards,
newspaper reading, travel, all manner of shows and
pleasures. They pursue all these amusements in deadly
earnest, as if they were serious avocations, as indeed they
are. If men possessed none of these distractions, half
of them would kill themselves out of hand, for to live a
life that is made up of contradictions is simply unbearable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and such is the life that most of us lead at the
present day. We are living in direct contradiction to
our inmost convictions. This contradiction is evident
both in economic and in political relations; it is manifested
most unmistakably in the inconsistency of the
acknowledgment of the Christian law of brotherly love
and military conscription, which obliges men to hold
themselves in readiness to take each other's lives,&mdash;in
short, every man to be at once a Christian and a
gladiator.</p>

<h3>ATTITUDE OF MEN OF THE PRESENT DAY TOWARD WAR</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Men do not endeavor to destroy the contradiction between life and consciousness
by a change of life, but educated men use all their power to
stifle the demands of consciousness and to justify their lives, and thus
degrade society to a condition worse than pagan, to a state of primeval
savagery&mdash;Uncertainty of the attitude of our leading men toward war,
universal armament, and general military conscription&mdash;Those who

<p>The contradictions of life and of consciousness may
be solved in two ways: by change of life, or by change
of consciousness; and it would seem as if there could
be no hesitation in a choice between the two.</p>

<p>When a man acknowledges a deed to be evil he may
refrain from the deed itself, but he can never cease to
regard it as evil. Indeed, the whole world might cease
from evil-doing, and yet have no power to transform, or
even to check for a season, the progress of knowledge
in regard to that which is evil, and which ought not to
exist. One would think that the alternative of a change
of life to accord with consciousness might be settled without
question, and that it would therefore seem unavoidable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
for the Christian world of the present day to abandon
those pagan forms which it condemns, and regulate its
life by the Christian precepts which it acknowledges.</p>

<p>Such would be the result were it not for the principle
of inertia (a principle no less unalterable in human life
than in the world of matter), which finds its expression
in the psychological law defined in the gospel by the
words: "Men loved darkness rather than light, because
their deeds were evil" (John iii. 19). Most persons, in
conformity to this principle, do not use their reason in
order to ascertain the truth, but rather to persuade themselves
that they possess it, and that their daily life, which
is pleasant for them, is in harmony with the precepts of
truth.</p>

<p>Slavery conflicted with all the moral principles taught
by Plato and Aristotle, and yet neither of them perceived
this, because the disavowal of slavery must have
destroyed that life by which they lived. And the same
thing is repeated in our times.</p>

<p>The division of mankind into two classes, the existence
of political and military injustice, is opposed to
all those moral principles which our society professes,
and yet the most progressive and cultivated men of the
age seem not to perceive this.</p>

<p>Almost every educated man at the present day is
striving unconsciously to preserve the old-time conception
of society, which justifies his attitude, and to conceal
from others and from himself its inconsistencies,
chief among which is the necessity of adopting the
Christian ideal, which is subversive of the very structure
of our social existence. It is this antiquated social
system, in which they no longer believe, because it is
really a thing of the past, that men are trying to uphold.</p>

<p>Contemporary literature, philosophical, political, and
artistic,&mdash;all contemporary literature affords a striking
proof of the truth of my statement. What wealth of
imagination, what form and color, what erudition and
art, but what a lack of serious purpose, what reluctance
to face any exact thought! Ambiguity of expression,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
indirect allusion, witticisms, vague reflection, but no
straightforward or candid dealing with the subject they
treat of, namely, life.</p>

<p>Indeed, our writers treat of obscenities and improprieties;
in the guise of refined paradox they convey
suggestions which thrust men back to primeval savagery,
to the lowest dregs, not only of pagan life, but
animal life, which we outlived 5000 years ago. Delivering
themselves from the Christian life-conception,
which for some simply interferes with the accustomed
current of their lives, while for others it interferes with
certain advantages, men must of necessity return to the
pagan life-conception and to the doctrines to which it
gave rise. Not only are patriotism and the rights of the
aristocracy preached at the present time as they used to
be 2000 years ago, but also the coarsest epicureanism
and sensuality, with this difference only,&mdash;that the
teachers of old believed in the doctrines they taught,
whereas those of the present day neither do nor can
possess any faith in what they utter, because there is
no longer any sense in it. When the ground is shifting
under our feet, we cannot stand still, we must either
recede or advance. It sounds exaggerated to say that
the enlightened men of our time, the advanced thinkers,
are speciously degrading society, plunging it into a
condition worse than pagan,&mdash;into a state of primeval
barbarism.</p>

<p>In no other matter has this tendency of the leading
men of our time been so plainly shown as in their
attitude toward that phenomenon in which at present
all the inconsistency of social life is concentrated,&mdash;toward
war, universal armament, and military conscription.</p>

<p>The equivocal, if not unscrupulous, attitude of the
educated men of our time toward this question is a
striking one. It may be stated from three points of
view. Some regard this phenomenon as an accidental
state of affairs, which has sprung from the peculiar
political situation of Europe, and believe it to be susceptible
of adjustment by diplomatic and international<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
mediation, without injury to the structure of nations.
Others look upon it as something appalling and cruel,
fatal yet unavoidable,&mdash;like disease or death. Still
others, in cold blood, calmly pronounce war to be an
indispensable, salutary, and therefore desirable event.</p>

<p>Men may differ in their views in regard to this matter,
but all discuss it as something with which the will of the
individuals who are to take part in it has nothing whatever
to do; therefore they do not even admit the natural
question which presents itself to most men; viz., "Is it
my duty to take part in it?" In the opinion of these
judges there is no reason in such a question, and every
man, whatever may be his personal prejudices in regard
to war, must submit in this matter to the demands of the
ruling powers.</p>

<p>The attitude of those in the first category, who expect
deliverance from war by means of diplomatic and international
mediation, is well defined in the results of the
London Peace Congress, and in an article, together with
letters concerning war from prominent writers, which may
be found in the <cite>Revue des Revues</cite> (No. 8, 1891).</p>

<p>These are the results of the Congress.</p>

<p>Having collected from all parts of the globe the
opinions of scientists, both written and oral, the Congress,
opening with a <em>Te Deum</em> in the cathedral, and
closing with a dinner and speeches, listened for five
days to numerous addresses, and arrived at the following
conclusions:&mdash;</p>

<p>Resolution I. The Congress affirms its belief that the
brotherhood of man involves as a necessary consequence
a brotherhood of nations, in which, the true interests of
all are acknowledged to be identical. The Congress is
convinced that the true basis for an enduring peace will
be found in the application by nations of this great
principle in all their relations one to another.</p>

<p>II. The Congress recognizes the important influence
which Christianity exercises upon the moral and political
progress of mankind, and earnestly urges upon
ministers of the gospel and other teachers of religion
and morality the duty of setting forth these principles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
of Peace and Good-will, which occupy such a central
place in the teaching of Jesus Christ, of philosophers
and of moralists, and <em>it recommends that the third
Sunday in December in each year be set apart for that
purpose</em>.</p>

<p>III. The Congress expresses its opinion that all
teachers of history should call the attention of the young
to the grave evils inflicted on mankind in all ages by
war, and to the fact that such war has been waged, as a
rule, for most inadequate causes.</p>

<p>IV. The Congress protests against the use of military
drill in connection with the physical exercises of schools,
and suggests the formation of brigades for saving life
rather than any of quasi-military character; and it urges
the desirability of impressing on the Board of Examiners,
who formulate the questions for examination, the propriety
of guiding the minds of children into the principles
of Peace.</p>

<p>V. The Congress holds that the doctrine of the universal
rights of man requires that aboriginal and weaker
races shall be guarded from injustice and fraud when
brought into contact with civilized peoples, alike as to
their territories, their liberties, and their property, and
that they shall be shielded from the vices which are so
prevalent among the so-called advanced races of men.
It further expresses its conviction that there should be
concert of action among the nations for the accomplishment
of these ends. The Congress desires to express
its hearty appreciation of the conclusions arrived at by
the late Anti-Slavery Conference, held in Brussels, for
the amelioration of the condition of the peoples of
Africa.</p>

<p>VI. The Congress believes that the warlike prejudices
and traditions which are still fostered in the various
nationalities, and the misrepresentations by leaders of
public opinion in legislative assemblies, or through the
press, are not infrequently indirect causes of war. The
Congress is therefore of opinion that these ends should
be counteracted by the publication of accurate statements
and information that would tend to the removal of misunderstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
amongst nations, and recommends to the
Inter-Parliamentary Committee the importance of considering
the question of starting an international newspaper,
which should have such a purpose as one of its
primary objects.</p>

<p>VII. The Congress proposes to the Inter-Parliamentary
Conference that the utmost support should be given
to every project for the unification of weights and measures,
of coinage, tariffs, postal and telegraphic arrangements,
means of transport, etc., which would assist in
constituting a commercial, industrial, and scientific union
of the peoples.</p>

<p>VIII. In view of the vast moral and social influence
of woman, the Congress urges upon every woman
throughout the world to sustain, as wife, mother, sister,
or citizen, the things that make for peace, as otherwise
she incurs grave responsibilities for the continuance of
the systems of war and militarism, which not only desolate
but corrupt the home-life of the nation. To concentrate
and to practically apply this influence, the Congress
recommends that women should unite themselves with
societies for the promotion of international peace.</p>

<p>IX. This Congress expresses the hope that the Financial
Reform Association and other similar societies in
Europe and America should unite in convoking at an
early date a conference to consider the best means of
establishing equitable commercial relations between
States by the reduction of import duties as a step
toward Free Trade. The Congress feels that it can
affirm that the whole of Europe desires Peace, and is
impatiently waiting for the moment when it shall see
the end of those crushing armaments which, under the
plea of defense, become in their turn a danger, by keeping
alive mutual distrust, and are, at the same time, the
cause of the general economic disturbance which stands
in the way of settling in a satisfactory manner the problems
of labor and poverty, which should take precedence
of all others.</p>

<p>X. This Congress, recognizing that a general disarmament
would be the best guarantee of <em>Peace</em>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
would lead to the solution, in the general interest, of
those questions which now must divide States, expresses
the wish that a Congress of Representatives of all the
States of Europe may be assembled as soon as possible
to consider the means of effecting a gradual general disarmament,
which already seems feasible.</p>

<p>XI. This Congress, considering that the timidity of a
single Power or other cause might delay indefinitely the
convocation of the above-mentioned Congress, is of the
opinion that the Government which should first dismiss
any considerable number of soldiers would confer a signal
benefit on Europe and mankind, because it would
oblige other Governments, urged on by public opinion,
to follow its example, and by the moral force of this
accomplished fact would have increased rather than
diminished the conditions of its national defense.</p>

<p>XII. This Congress, considering the question of disarmament,
as well as the Peace question generally, depends
upon public opinion, recommends the Peace
Societies here represented, and all friends of Peace, to
carry on an active propaganda among the people, especially
at the time of Parliamentary elections, in order
that the electors should give their votes to those candidates
who have included in their programme Peace,
Disarmament, and Arbitration.</p>

<p>XIII. This Congress congratulates the friends of
Peace on the resolution adopted by the International
American Conference (with the exception of the representatives
of Chili and Mexico) at Washington in April
last, by which it was recommended that arbitration
should be obligatory in all controversies concerning
diplomatic and consular privileges, boundaries, territories,
indemnities, right of navigation, and the validity,
construction, and enforcement of treaties, and in all
other causes, whatever their origin, nature, or occasion,
except only those which, in the judgment of any of the
nations involved in the controversy, may imperil its
independence.</p>

<p>XIV. This Congress respectfully recommends this
resolution to the statesmen of Europe, and expresses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
the ardent desire that treaties in similar terms be
speedily entered into between the other nations of the
world.</p>

<p>XV. This Congress expresses its satisfaction at the
adoption by the Spanish Senate, on June 18th last, of a
project of law authorizing the Government to negotiate
general or special treaties of arbitration for the settlement
of all disputes, except those relating to the independence
and internal government of the States affected;
also at the adoption of resolutions to a like effect by the
Norwegian Storthing on March 6th last, and by the
Italian Chamber on July 11th.</p>

<p>XVI. That a committee of five be appointed to prepare
and address communications, in the name of the
Congress, to the principal religious, political, economical,
labor, and peace organizations in civilized countries,
requesting them to send petitions to the governmental
authorities of their respective countries, praying that
measures be taken for the formation of suitable tribunals
for the adjudication of international questions, so
as to avoid the resort to war.</p>

<p>XVII. Seeing (1) that the object pursued by all Peace
Societies is the establishment of juridical order between
nations:</p>

<p>(2) That neutralization by international treaties constitutes
a step toward this juridical state, and lessens
the number of districts in which war can be carried
on:</p>

<p>This Congress recommends a larger extension of the
rule of neutralization, and expresses the wish:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) That all treaties which at present assure to certain
States the benefit of neutrality remain in force, or, if
necessary, be amended in a manner to render the neutrality
more effective, either by extending neutralization
to the whole of the State, of which a part only may be
neutralized, or by ordering the demolition of fortresses,
which constitute rather a peril than a guarantee for
neutrality.</p>

<p>(2) That new treaties, provided that they are in harmony
with the wishes of the populations concerned, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
concluded for establishing the neutralization of other
States.</p>

<p>XVIII. The Committee Section proposes:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) That the next Congress be held immediately before
or immediately after the next session of the Inter-Parliamentary
Conference, and at the same places.</p>

<p>(2) That the question of an international Peace
Emblem be postponed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine die</i>.</p>

<p>(3) The adoption of the following resolutions:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Resolved, that we express our satisfaction at the
formal and official overtures of the Presbyterian Church
in the United States of America, addressed to the highest
representatives of each church organization in Christendom,
inviting the same to unite with itself in a general
conference, the object of which shall be to promote the
substitution of international arbitration for war.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) That this Congress, assembled in London from
the 14th to the 19th July, desires to express its profound
reverence for the memory of Aurelio Salfi, the
great Italian jurist, a member of the Committee of the
International League of Peace and Liberty.</p>

<p>(4) That the memorial to the various heads of the
civilized States adopted by this Congress, and signed by
the President, should, so far as practicable, be presented
to each Power by an influential deputation.</p>

<p>(5) That the Organization Committee be empowered
to make the needful verbal emendations in the papers
and resolutions presented.</p>

<p>(6) That the following resolutions be adopted:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) A resolution of thanks to the Presidents of the
various sittings of the Congress.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) A resolution of thanks to the chairman, the secretary,
and the members of the Bureau of this Congress.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) A resolution of thanks to the conveners and members
of the sectional committees.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) A resolution of thanks to Rev. Canon Scott Holland,
Rev. Dr. Reuan Thomas, and Rev. J. Morgan
Gibbon, for their pulpit addresses before the Congress,
and that they be requested to furnish copies of the same
for publication; and also Stamford Hall Congregational<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Church for the use of those buildings for public services.</p>

<p>(<em>e</em>) A letter of thanks to Her Majesty for permission
to visit Windsor Castle.</p>

<p>(<em>f</em>) And also a resolution of thanks to the Lord Mayor
and Lady Mayoress, to Mr. Passmore Edwards, and other
friends who have extended their hospitality to the members
of the Congress.</p>

<p>XIX. This Congress places on record a heartfelt expression
of gratitude to Almighty God for the remarkable
harmony and concord which have characterized the
meetings of the Assembly, in which so many men and
women of varied nations, creeds, tongues, and races have
gathered in closest coöperation; and in the conclusion
of the labors of this Congress, it expresses its firm and
unshaken belief in the ultimate triumph of the cause of
<em>Peace</em>, and of the principles which have been advocated
at these meetings.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The fundamental idea of the Congress is&mdash;firstly, that
it is necessary to disseminate by all means among all men
the belief that war is not advantageous for mankind, and
that peace is a great benefit; and secondly, to influence
governments, impressing upon them the advantages and
necessity of disarmament.</p>

<p>To accomplish the first end, the Congress advises teachers
of history, women, and ministers of the gospel,
to teach people, every third Sunday of December, the
evils of war and the benefits of peace; to accomplish
the second, the Congress addresses itself to governments,
suggesting to them disarmament and arbitration.</p>

<p>To preach the evils of war and the benefits of peace!
But the evils of war are so well known to men, that from
the earliest ages the most welcome greeting was always:
"Peace be unto you!"</p>

<p>Not only Christians but all pagans were fully aware
of the benefits of peace and of the evils of war thousands
of years ago, so that the advice to the ministers of the
gospel to preach against the evils of war and to advocate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the benefits of peace every third Sunday in December
is quite superfluous.</p>

<p>A real Christian cannot do otherwise than preach thus,
constantly, as long as he lives. But if there are those
who are called Christians, or Christian preachers, who do
not do this, there must be a cause for it, and so long as
this cause exists no advice will avail. Still less effective
will be the advice to governments to disband armies and
have recourse to International Courts of Arbitration.
Governments know very well all the difficulties and burdens
of conscription and of maintaining armies, and if
in the face of such difficulties and burdens they still continue
to do so, it is evident that they have no means of
doing otherwise, and the advice of a Congress could in
no way bring about a change. But scientists will not
admit this, and still hope to find some combination of
influences by means of which those governments which
make war may be induced to restrain themselves.</p>

<p>"Is it possible to avoid war?" writes a scientist in the
<cite>Revue des Revues</cite> (No. 8 of 1891). "All agree in recognizing
the fact that if war should ever break out in
Europe, its consequences would be similar to those of
the great invasions. It would imperil the very existence
of nations; it would be bloody, atrocious, desperate.
This consideration, and the consideration of the terrible
nature of the engines of destruction at the command of
modern science, retards its declaration and temporarily
maintains the present system,&mdash;a system which might
be continued indefinitely, if it were not for the enormous
expenses that burden the European nations and threaten
to culminate in disasters fully equal to those occasioned
by war.</p>

<p>"Impressed with these thoughts, men of all nationalities
have sought for means to arrest, or at least to diminish,
the shocking consequences of the carnage that
threatens us.</p>

<p>"Such are the questions which are to be debated by
the next Congress of Universal Peace to be held in
Rome, which have already been discussed in a recently
published pamphlet on Disarmament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>"Unfortunately, it is quite certain that with the present
organization of the greater number of the European
states, isolated one from the other and controlled by
different interests, the absolute cessation of war is an
illusion which it would be folly to cherish. Still, the
adoption of somewhat wiser rules and regulations in
regard to these international duels would at least tend to
limit their horrors. It is equally Utopian to build one's
hope on projects of disarmament, whose execution, owing
to considerations of a national character, which exist in
the minds of all our readers, is practically impossible."
(This probably means that France cannot disarm until
she has retaliated.) "Public opinion is not prepared to
accept them, and, furthermore, the international relations
make it impossible to adopt them. Disarmament
demanded by one nation of another, under conditions
imperiling its security, would be equivalent to a declaration
of war.</p>

<p>"Still, we must admit that an exchange of opinions
between the nations interested may to a certain extent
aid in establishing an international understanding, and
also contribute to lessen the military expenses that now
crush European nations, to the great detriment of the
solution of social questions, the necessity of the solution
of which is realized by each nation individually, under
the penalty of being confronted by a civil war, due to
the efforts made to prevent a foreign one.</p>

<p>"One may at least hope for a decrease of the enormous
expenses necessary for the present military organization,
which is maintained for the purpose of invading
a foreign territory in twenty-four hours, or of a decisive
battle a week after the declaration of war."</p>

<p>It ought not to be possible for one nation to attack
another and take possession of its territory within twenty-four
hours. This practical sentiment was expressed by
Maxime du Camp, and is the conclusion of his study of
the subject.</p>

<p>Maxime du Camp offers the following propositions:&mdash;</p>

<p>"1st. A Diplomatic Congress, to assemble every
year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"2d. No war to be declared until two months after
the incident which gave rise to it." (Here the difficulty
lies in determining the nature of the incident that kindled
the war&mdash;that is, every declaration of war is caused
by several circumstances, and it would be necessary to
determine from which one the two months are to be
reckoned.)</p>

<p>"3d. No war shall be declared until the vote of the
people shall have been taken.</p>

<p>"4th. Hostilities must not begin until a month after
the declaration of war."</p>

<p>"<em>No war shall be declared</em> ..." etc. But who is to
<em>prevent</em> hostilities <em>beginning</em>? Who will compel men
to do this or that? Who will compel governments to
wait a certain stated time? Other nations. But all
the other nations are in the very same position, requiring
to be restrained and kept within bounds, in other words,
<em>coerced</em>. And who will <em>coerce</em> them? And how is it to
be done? By public opinion. But if public opinion
has sufficient influence to force a nation to postpone its
action until a stated time, this public opinion can prevent
it from waging war at any time.</p>

<p>But, it is said, there might be a balance of power,
which would oblige nations to restrain themselves. This
very experiment has been and is still being tried; this
was the object of the Holy Alliance, the League of
Peace, etc.</p>

<p>But all would agree to this, it is said. If all would
agree to this, then wars would cease, and there would be
no need of Courts of Appeal or of Arbitration.</p>

<p>"A Court of Arbitration would take the place of war.
Disputes would be decided by a Board of Arbitrators,
like that which pronounced on the Alabama claims.
The Pope has been requested to decide the question concerning
the Caroline Islands: Switzerland, Belgium, Denmark,
and Holland have declared that they prefer the
decision of a Court of Arbitration to war."</p>

<p>I believe Monaco has expressed a similar wish. It is
a pity that Germany, Russia, Austria, and France have
thus far shown no sign of imitating their example.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>It is astonishing how easily men can deceive themselves
when they feel inclined.</p>

<p>The governments will agree to allow their disputes
to be decided by a Board of Arbitration and to dismiss
their armies. The trouble between Russia and Poland,
England and Ireland, Austria and the Czechs, Turkey
and the Slavs, France and Germany, will be settled by
mutual consent. This is very much like suggesting to
merchants and bankers that they shall sell at cost price,
and devote their services gratuitously to the distribution
of property.</p>

<p>Of course the essence of commerce and banking consists
in buying cheap and selling dear, and therefore
the suggestion to sell at cost price and the consequent
overthrow of money amounts to a proposal of self-destruction.</p>

<p>The same is true in regard to governments.</p>

<p>The suggestion to governments to desist from violence,
and to adjust all differences by arbitration, would
be to recommend a suicidal policy, and no government
would ever agree to that. Learned men found societies
(there are more than one hundred of them), they assemble
in Congresses (like those held in London and Paris
and the one which is to be held in Rome), they read
essays, hold banquets, make speeches, edit journals
devoted to the subject, and by all these means they
endeavor to prove that the strain upon nations who are
obliged to support millions of soldiers has become so
severe that something must be done about it; that this
armament is opposed to the character, the aims, and the
wishes of the populations; but they seem to think that
if they consume a good deal of paper, and devote a
good deal of eloquence to the subject, that they may
succeed in conciliating opposing parties and conflicting
interests, and at last effect the suppression of war.</p>

<p>When I was a child I was told that if I wished to
catch a bird I must put salt on its tail. I took a handful
and went in pursuit of the birds, but I saw at once
that if I could sprinkle salt on their tails I could catch
them, and that what I had been told was only a joke.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Those who read essays and works on Courts of Arbitration
and the disarmament of nations must feel very
much the same.</p>

<p>If it were possible to sprinkle salt on a bird's tail it
would be tantamount to saying that the bird could not
fly, and therefore it would be no effort to catch it. If
a bird has wings and does not wish to be caught, it will
not allow any salt to be put on its tail, for it is the nature
of a bird to fly. Likewise it is the nature of a government
not to be ruled, but to rule its subjects. And a
government rightly is named such only when it is able
to rule its subjects, and not be ruled by them. This,
therefore, is its constant aim, and it will never voluntarily
resign its power. And as it derives its power
from the army it will never give up the army, nor will
it ever renounce that for which the army is designed,&mdash;war.</p>

<p>The misapprehension springs from the fact that the
learned jurists, deceiving themselves as well as others,
depict in their books an ideal of government,&mdash;not as
it really is, an assembly of men who oppress their
fellow-citizens, but in accordance with the scientific postulate,
as a body of men who act as the representatives
of the rest of the nation. They have gone on repeating
this to others so long that they have ended by believing
it themselves, and they really seem to think that justice
is one of the duties of governments. History, however,
shows us that governments, as seen from the reign of
Cæsar to those of the two Napoleons and Prince Bismarck,
are in their very essence a violation of justice;
a man or a body of men having at command an army
of trained soldiers, deluded creatures who are ready for
any violence, and through whose agency they govern
the State, will have no keen sense of the obligation of
justice. Therefore governments will never consent to
diminish the number of those well-trained and submissive
servants, who constitute their power and influence.</p>

<p>Such is the attitude of certain scientists toward that
self-contradiction under which the world groans, and
such are their expedients for its relief. Tell these scientists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
that the question deals only with the personal
relations of each individual toward the moral and religious
question, and then ask them what they think of
the lawfulness or unlawfulness of taking part in the general
conscription, and their sole reply will be a shrug of
the shoulders; they will not even deign to give a thought
to your question. Their way of solving the difficulty is
to make speeches, write books, choose their presidents,
vice-presidents, and secretaries; assembled in a body, to
hold forth in one city or another. They think that the
result of their efforts will be to induce governments to
cease to recruit soldiers, on whom all their power depends;
they expect that their appeals will be heard, and
that armies will be disbanded, leaving governments defenseless,
not only in the presence of neighbors, but of
their subjects; that they, like highwaymen who, having
bound their defenseless victims in order to rob them, no
sooner hear the outcries of pain than they loosen the
rope that causes it, and let their prisoners go free.</p>

<p>And there really are men who believe in this, who
spend their time in promoting Leagues of Peace, in
delivering addresses, and in writing books; and of
course the governments sympathize with it all, pretending
that they approve of it; just as they pretend to support
temperance, while they actually derive the larger
part of their income from intemperance; just as they
pretend to maintain liberty of the constitution, when
it is the absence of liberty to which they owe their
power; just as they pretend to care for the improvement
of the laboring classes, while on oppression of the workman
rest the very foundations of the State; just as they
pretend to uphold Christianity, when Christianity is subversive
of every government.</p>

<p>In order to accomplish these ends they have long
since instituted laws in regard to intemperance that can
never avail to destroy it; educational projects that not
only do not prevent the spread of ignorance, but do
everything to increase it; decrees in the name of liberty
that are no restraint upon despotism; measures for the
benefit of the working-man which will never liberate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
him from slavery; they have established a Christianity
which serves to prop the government rather than destroy
it. And now another interest is added to their
cares,&mdash;the promotion of peace. Governments, or
rather those rulers who are going about at present with
their ministers of state, making up their minds on such
radical questions as, for instance, whether the slaughter
of millions shall begin this year or next,&mdash;they are quite
well assured that discussions on peace are not going to
prevent them from sending millions of men to slaughter
whenever they see fit to do so. They like to hear these
discussions, they encourage them, and even take part
themselves.</p>

<p>It does no harm to the government; on the contrary,
it is useful, by way of diverting observation from that
radical question: When a man is drafted, ought he or
ought he not to fulfil his military duty?</p>

<p>Thanks to all these unions and congresses, peace will
presently be established; meanwhile put on your uniforms,
and be prepared to worry and harass each other
for our benefit, say the governments. And the scientists,
the essayists, and the promoters of congresses take
the same view.</p>

<p>This is one way of looking at it, and so advantageous
for the State that all prudent governments encourage it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The way another class has of regarding it is more
tragic. They declare that although it is the fate of
humanity to be forever striving after love and peace, it
is nevertheless abnormal and inconsistent. Those who
affirm this are mostly the sensitive men of genius, who
see and realize all the horror, folly, and cruelty of war,
but by some strange turn of mind never look about them
for any means of escape, but who seem to take a morbid
delight in realizing to the utmost the desperate condition
of mankind. The view of the famous French
writer, Maupassant, on the subject of war, affords a
noteworthy example of this kind. Gazing from his
yacht upon a drill and target-practice of French soldiers,
the following thoughts arise in his mind:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I have but to think of the word 'war' and a paralyzing
sense of horror creeps over me, as though I
were listening to stories of witchcraft, or tales of the
Inquisition, or of things abominable, monstrous, unnatural,
of ages past.</p>

<p>"When people talk of cannibals we smile contemptuously
with a sense of superiority to such savages.
But who are the savages, the true savages? Those
who fight that they may drive off the conquered, or
those who fight for the pure pleasure of killing? Those
sharp-shooters running over yonder are destined to be
killed like a flock of sheep who are driven by the
butcher to the slaughter-house. Those men will fall on
some battlefield with a sabre-cut in the head, or with a
ball through the heart. Yet they are young men, who
might have done useful work. Their fathers are old
and poor; their mothers, who have idolized them for
twenty years as only mothers can idolize, will learn
after six months, or perhaps a year, that the son, the
baby, the grown-up child on whom so much love and
pains were lavished, who was reared at such an expense,
has been torn by a bullet, trampled under foot, or crushed
by a cavalry charge, and finally flung like a dead dog
into some ditch. Why must her boy, her beautiful, her
only boy, the hope and pride of her life, why must he
be killed? She knows not; she can but ask why.</p>

<p>"War!... The fighting!... The murdering!... The
slaughter of men!... And to-day, with all our wisdom,
civilization, with the advancement of science, the degree
of philosophy to which the human spirit has attained,
we have schools where the art of murder, of
aiming with deadly accuracy and killing large numbers
of men at a distance, is actually taught, killing poor,
harmless devils who have families to support, killing
them without even the pretext of the law.</p>

<p>"<em>It is stupefying that the people do not rise up in arms
against the governments. What difference is there between
monarchies and republics? It is stupefying that
society does not revolt as a unit at the very sound of the
word war.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>"Alas! we shall never be free from oppression of
the hateful, hideous customs, the criminal prejudices,
and the ferocious impulses of our barbarous ancestors,
for we are beasts; and beasts we shall remain, moved
by our instincts and susceptible of no improvement.</p>

<p>"Any one but Victor Hugo would have been banished
when he uttered his sublime cry of freedom and
truth:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'To-day force is called violence, and the nations
condemn it; they inveigh against war. Civilization,
listening to the appeal of humanity, undertakes the
case and prepares the accusation against the victors
and the generals. The nations begin to understand
that the magnitude of a crime cannot lessen its wickedness;
that if it be criminal to kill one man, the killing
of numbers cannot be regarded in the light of extenuation;
that if it be shameful to steal, it cannot be glorious
to lead an invading army.</p>

<p>"'Let us proclaim these absolute truths, let us dishonor
the name of war!'</p>

<p>"But the wrath and indignation of the poet are all in
vain," continues Maupassant. "War is more honored
than ever.</p>

<p>"A clever expert in this business, a genius in the art
of murder, Von Moltke, once made to a peace-delegate
the following astonishing reply:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'War is sacred; it is a divine institution; it fosters
every lofty and noble sentiment in the human heart:
honor, self-sacrifice, virtue, courage, and saves men, so
to speak, from settling into the most shocking materialism.'</p>

<p>"Assembling in herds by the hundred thousand,
marching night and day without rest, with no time for
thought or for study, never to read, learning nothing,
of no use whatsoever to any living being, rotting with
filth, sleeping in the mud, living like a wild beast in a
perennial state of stupidity, plundering cities, burning
villages, ruining whole nations; then to encounter
another mountain of human flesh, rush upon it, cause
rivers of blood to flow, and strew the fields with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
dead and the dying, all stained with the muddy and
reddened soil, to have one's limbs severed, one's brain
scattered as wanton waste, and to perish in the corner
of a field while one's aged parents, one's wife and children,
are dying of hunger at home,&mdash;this is what it
means to be saved from falling into the grossest materialism!</p>

<p>"Soldiers are the scourge of the world. We struggle
against nature, ignorance, all kinds of obstacles, in the
effort to make our wretched lives more endurable.
There are men, scientists and philanthropists, who devote
their whole lives to benefit their fellow-men, seeking
to improve their condition. They pursue their
efforts tirelessly, adding discovery to discovery, expanding
the human intelligence, enriching science, opening
new fields of knowledge, day by day increasing the
well-being, comfort, and vigor of their country.</p>

<p>"Then war comes upon the scene, and in six months
all the results of twenty years of patient labor and of
human genius are gone forever, crushed by victorious
generals.</p>

<p>"And this is what they mean when they speak of
man's rescue from materialism!</p>

<p>"We have seen war. We have seen men maddened;
returned to the condition of the brutes, we have seen
them kill in wanton sport, out of terror, or for mere
bravado and show. Where right exists no longer, and
law is dead, where all sense of justice has been lost, we
have seen innocent men shot down on the highway, because
they were timid and thus excited suspicion. We
have seen dogs chained to their masters' doors killed
by way of target-practice, we have seen cows lying in
a field fired at by the mitrailleuses, just for the fun of
shooting at something.</p>

<p>"And this is what they call saving men from the
most shocking materialism!</p>

<p>"To invade a country, to kill the man who defends
his home because he wears a blouse and does not wear
a <em>kepi</em>, to burn the dwellings of starving wretches, to
ruin or plunder a man's household goods, to drink the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
wine found in the cellars, to violate the women found
in the streets, consume millions of francs in powder,
and to leave misery and cholera in their track.</p>

<p>"This is what they mean by saving men from the
most shocking materialism!</p>

<p>"What have military men ever done to prove that
they possess the smallest degree of intelligence? Nothing
whatever. What have they invented? The cannon
and the musket; nothing more.</p>

<p>"Has not the inventor of the wheelbarrow, by the
simple and practical contrivance of a wheel and a couple
of boards, accomplished more than the inventor of
modern fortification?</p>

<p>"What has Greece bequeathed to the world? Its
literature and its marbles. Was she great because she
conquered, or because she produced? Was it the
Persian invasion that saved Greece from succumbing
to the most shocking materialism?</p>

<p>"Did the invasions of the Barbarians save and regenerate
Rome?</p>

<p>"Did Napoleon I. continue the great intellectual
movement started by the philosophers at the end of the
last century?</p>

<p>"Very well, then; can it be a matter of surprise, since
governments usurp the rights of life and death over the
people, that the people from time to time assume the
right of life and death over their governments?</p>

<p>"They defend themselves, and they have the right.
No man has an inalienable right to govern others. It
is allowable only when it promotes the welfare of the
governed. It is as much the duty of those who govern
to avoid war as it is that of a captain of a ship to avoid
shipwreck.</p>

<p>"When a captain has lost his ship he is indicted, and
if he is found to have been careless or even incompetent,
he is convicted. As soon as war has been declared why
should not the people sit in judgment upon the act of
the government?</p>

<p>"If they could once be made to understand the power
that would be theirs, <em>if they were the judges of the rulers</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
<em>who lead them on to slay their fellow-men, if they refused
to allow themselves to be needlessly slaughtered,
if they were to turn their weapons against the very men
who have put them into their hands&mdash;that day would see
the last of war.... But never will that day arrive."</em>&mdash;"Sur
l'Eau."</p></blockquote>

<p>The author perceives the full horror of war, realizes
that the government is its author, that government
forces men to go slay, or be slain, when there is no need
for it; he realizes that the men who make up the armies
might turn their weapons against the government and
demand a reckoning. Still the author does not believe
that this will ever happen, or that there is any possible
deliverance from the existing condition of affairs.</p>

<p>He grants that the result of war is shocking, but he
believes it to be inevitable; assuming that the never
ceasing requisition of soldiers on the part of government
is as inevitable as death, then wars must follow as a
matter of course.</p>

<p>These are the words of a writer of talent, endowed
with a faculty of vividly realizing his subject, which is
the essence of the poetic gift. He shows us all the cruel
contradictions between creed and deed; but since he
fails to offer a solution, it is evident that he feels that
such a contradiction must exist, and regards it as a contribution
to the romantic tragedy of life. Another and
an equally gifted writer, Edouard Rod, paints with
colors still more vivid the cruelty and folly of the present
situation, but he, like Maupassant, feels the influence of
the dramatic element, and neither suggests a remedy nor
anticipates any change.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Why do we toil? Why do we plan and hope to
execute? And how can one even love one's neighbor in
these troublous times, when the morrow is nothing but
a menace?... Everything that we have begun, our
ripening schemes, our plans for work, the little good that
we might accomplish, will it not all be swept away by
the storm that is gathering?... Everywhere the soil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
quakes beneath our feet, and threatening clouds hang
low on the horizon. Ah! if we had nothing more to
fear than the bugbear of the Revolution!... Unable
to conceive a society worse than our own, I am more
inclined to distrust than to fear the one that may replace
it, and if I should suffer in consequence of the change,
I should console myself with the reflection that the
executioners of the present were victims of the past, and
the hope of a change for the better would make me
endure the worst. But it is not this remote danger
which alarms me. I see another close at hand and far
more cruel, since it is both unjustifiable and irrational,
and nothing good can come out of it. Day by day the
chances of war are weighed, and day by day they become
more pitiless.</p>

<p>"The human mind refuses to believe in the catastrophe
which even now looms up before us, and which the
close of this century must surely witness, a catastrophe
which will put an end to all the progress of our age, and
yet we must try to realize it. Science has devoted all
her energy these twenty years to the invention of destructive
weapons, and soon a few cannon-balls will
suffice to destroy an army;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> not the few thousands of
wretched mercenaries, whose life-blood has been bought
and paid for, but whole nations are about to exterminate
each other; during conscription their time is stolen from
them in order to steal their lives with more certainty.
By way of stimulating a thirst for blood mutual animosities
are excited, and gentle, kind-hearted men allow themselves
to be deluded, and it will not be long before they
attack each other with all the ferocity of wild beasts;
multitudes of peace-loving citizens will obey a foolish
command, God only knows on what pretext,&mdash;some
stupid frontier quarrel, perhaps, or it may be some colonial
mercantile interest.... They will go like a flock of
sheep to the slaughter, yet knowing where they go, conscious
that they are leaving their wives and their children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
to suffer hunger; anxious, but unable to resist the
enticement of those plausible and treacherous words
that have been trumpeted into their ears. <em>Unresistingly
they go; although they form a mass and a force, they fail
to realize the extent of their power, and that if they were
all agreed they might establish the reign of reason and
fraternity</em>, instead of lending themselves to the barbarous
trickeries of diplomacy.</p>

<p>"So self-deceived are they that bloodshed takes on
the aspect of duty, and they implore the blessing of God
upon their sanguinary hopes. As they march, they
trample underfoot the harvests which they themselves
have planted, burning the cities which they have helped
to build, with songs, shouts of enthusiasm, and music.
And their sons will raise a statue to those who have slain
them by the most approved methods.... The fate of a
whole generation hangs on the hour when some saturnine
politician shall make the sign, and the nations will
rush upon each other. We know that the noblest among
us will be cut down, and that our affairs will go to destruction.
<em>We know this, we tremble in anger, yet are
powerless.</em> We have been caught in a snare of bureaucracy
and waste paper from which we can only escape
by measures too energetic for us. We belong to the
laws which we have made for our protection, and which
oppress us. <em>We are nothing more than the creatures of
that antinomic abstraction, the State, which makes of each
individual a slave in the name of all, each individual of
which all, taken separately, would desire the exact contrary
of what he will be made to do.</em></p>

<p>"And if it were but the sacrifice of a single generation!
But many other interests are involved.</p>

<p>"Paid orators, demagogues, taking advantage of the
passions of the masses and of the simple-minded who
are dazzled by high-sounding phrases, have so embittered
national hatreds that to-morrow's war will decide
the fate of a race: one of the component parts of the
modern world is threatened; the vanquished nation will
morally disappear; it matters not which chances to be the
victim, a power will disappear (as though there had ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
been one too many for the good). A new Europe will
then be established on a basis so unjust, so brutal, so
bloodstained, that it cannot fail to be worse than that of
to-day,&mdash;more iniquitous, more barbarous, and more
aggressive....</p>

<p>"Thus a fearful depression hangs over us. We are
like men dashing up and down a narrow passageway,
with muskets pointed at us from all the roofs. We work
like sailors executing their last man&oelig;uver after the ship
has begun to sink. Our pleasures are those of the prisoner
to whom a choice dish is offered a quarter of
an hour before his execution. Anxiety paralyzes our
thought, and the utmost we can do is to wonder, as we
con the vague utterances of ministers, or construe the
meaning of the words of monarchs, or turn over those
ascribed to the diplomatists, retailed at random by the
newspapers, never sure of their information, whether all
this is to happen to-morrow or the day after, whether it
is this year or next that we are all to be killed. In truth,
one might seek in vain throughout the pages of history
for an epoch more unsettled or more pregnant with
anxiety."&mdash;"Le Sens de la Vie."</p></blockquote>

<p>He shows us that the power is really in the hands of
those who allow themselves to be destroyed, in the hands
of separate individuals who compose the mass; that the
root of all evil is the State. It would seem as if the contradiction
between one's faith and one's actual life had
reached its utmost limit, and that the solution could not
be far to seek.</p>

<p>But the author is of a different opinion. All that he
sees in this is the tragedy of human life, and having given
us a detailed description of the horror of this state of
things, he perceives no reason why human life should not
be spent in the midst of this horror. Such are the views
of the second class of writers, who consider only the
fatalistic and tragic side of war.</p>

<p>There is still another view, and this is the one held by
men who have lost all conscience, and are consequently
dead to common sense and human feeling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>To this class belong Moltke, whose opinions are quoted
by Maupassant, and nearly all military men who have
been taught to believe this cruel superstition, who are
supported by it, and who naturally regard war not only
as an inevitable evil, but as a necessary and even profitable
occupation. And there are civilians too, scientists,
men of refinement and education, who hold very much
the same views.</p>

<p>The famous academician Doucet, in reply to a query
of the editor of the <cite>Revue des Revues</cite> in regard to his
opinions on war, replies as follows in the number containing
letters concerning war:<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;When you ask of the least belligerent
of all the academicians if he is a partizan of war, his
reply is already given. Unfortunately you yourself classify
the peaceful contemplations which inspire your
fellow-countrymen at the present hour as idle visions.</p>

<p>"Ever since I was born I have always heard good men
protesting against this shocking custom of international
carnage. All recognize this evil and lament it. But
where is its remedy?</p>

<p>"The effort to suppress duelling has often been made.
It seems to be so easy. Far from it. All that has been
accomplished toward achieving this noble purpose
amounts to nothing, nor will it ever amount to more.
Against war and duelling the congresses of the two hemispheres
vote in vain. Superior to all arbitrations, conventions,
and legislations will ever remain human honor,
which has always demanded the duel, and national interests,
which have always called for war. Nevertheless,
I wish with all my heart that the Universal Peace Congress
may succeed at last in its difficult and honorable
task.&mdash;Accept the assurance, etc.,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Camille Doucet</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>It amounts to this, that honor obliges men to fight,
that it is for the interest of nations that they should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
attack and destroy one another, and that all endeavors
to abolish war can but excite a smile.</p>

<p>Jules Claretie expresses himself in similar terms:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;A sensible man can have but one
opinion on the question of war and peace. Humanity
was created to live&mdash;to live for the purpose of perfecting
its existence by peaceful labor. The mutual relations
of cordiality which are promoted and preached by
the Universal Congress of Peace may be but a dream
perhaps, yet certainly is the most delightful of dreams.
The vision of the land of promise is ever before the
eyes, and upon the soil of the future the harvest will
ripen, secure from the plowing of the projectile, or the
crushing of cannon-wheels. But, alas!... Since philosophers
and philanthropists are not the rulers of mankind,
it is fit that our soldiers should guard our frontiers
and our homes, and their weapons, skilfully wielded,
are perhaps the surest guarantees of the peace we love
so well. Peace is given only to the strong and the
courageous.&mdash;Accept the assurances of, etc.,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Jules Claretie</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>The substance of this is, that there is no harm in
talking about what no one intends to do, and what ought
not in any event to be done. When fighting is in order,
there is no alternative but to fight.</p>

<p>Émile Zola, the most popular novelist in Europe, gives
utterance to his views on the subject of war in the following
terms:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I look upon war as a fatal necessity which seems to
us indispensable because of its close connection with
human nature and all creation. Would that it might be
postponed as long as possible! Nevertheless a time
will come when we shall be forced to fight. At this
moment I am regarding the subject from the universal
standpoint, and am not hinting at our unfriendly relations
with Germany, which are but a trifling incident
in the world's history. I affirm that war is useful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
necessary, since it is one of the conditions of human
existence. The fighting instinct is to be found not only
among the different tribes and peoples, but in domestic
and private life as well. It is one of the chief elements
of progress, and every advancing step taken by mankind
up to the present time has been accompanied by bloodshed.</p>

<p>"Men have talked, and still do talk, of disarmament;
and yet disarmament is utterly impossible, for even
though it were possible, we should be compelled to
renounce it. It is only an armed nation that can be
powerful and great. I believe that a general disarmament
would be followed by a moral degradation, assuming
the form of a widespread effeminacy which would
impede the progress of humanity. Warlike nations
have always been vigorous. The military art has contributed
to the development of other arts. History
shows us this. In Athens and Rome, for instance,
commerce, industry, and literature reached their highest
development when these cities ruled the world by the
force of arms. And nearer to our own time we found
an example in the reign of Louis XIV. The wars of
the great king, so far from impeding the advance of arts
and sciences, seemed rather to promote and to favor
their progress."</p></blockquote>

<p>War is useful!</p>

<p>But chief among the advocates of these views, and
the most talented of all the writers of this tendency,
is the academician Vogüé, who, in an article on the
military section of the Exhibition of 1889, writes as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On the Esplanade des Invalides, the center of exotic
and colonial structures, a building of a more severe order
stands out from the midst of the picturesque bazaar;
these various fragments of our terrestrial globe adjoin
the palace of war. A magnificent theme and antithesis
for humanitarian rhetoric which never loses a chance
to lament a juxtaposition of this kind, and to utter its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
'this will kill that' [<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ceci tuera cela</i><a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>]; that the confederacy
of nations brought about by science and labor
will overpower the military instinct. Let it cherish this
vision of a golden age, caressing it with fond hopes.
We have no objection; but should it ever be realized, it
would very soon become an age of corruption. History
teaches us that the former has been accomplished by
the means of the latter, that blood is necessary to hasten
and to seal the confederacy of nations. In our own
time the natural sciences have strengthened the mysterious
law which revealed itself to Joseph de Maistre
through the inspiration of his genius and meditation on
primordial dogmas; he saw how the world would redeem
its hereditary fall by offering a sacrifice. Science
shows us that the world is made better by struggle and
violent selection; this affirmation of the same law, with
varied utterance, comes from two sources. It is by no
means a pleasant one. The laws of the world, however,
are not established for our pleasure, but for our perfection.
Let us then enter this necessary and indispensable
palace of war, and we shall have the opportunity to
observe how our most inveterate instinct, losing nothing
of its power, is transformed in its adaptation to the
various demands of historical moments."</p></blockquote>

<p>This idea, namely, that the proof of the necessity of
war may be found in the writings of De Maistre and of
Darwin, two great thinkers, as he calls them, pleases
Vogüé so much that he repeats it.</p>

<p>"Sir," he writes to the editor of the <cite>Revue des Revues</cite>,
"you ask my opinion in regard to the possible success
of the Universal Peace Congress. I believe, with
Darwin, that vehement struggle is the law governing all
being, and I believe, with Joseph de Maistre, that it is a
divine law,&mdash;two different modes of characterizing the
same principle. If, contrary to all expectations, a
certain fraction of humanity&mdash;for example, all the
civilized West&mdash;should succeed in arresting the issue
of this law, the more primitive races would execute it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
against us; in these races the voice of nature would
prevail over human intellect. And they would succeed,
because the certainty of <em>peace</em>&mdash;I do not say peace,
but the absolute <em>certainty of peace</em>&mdash;would in less
than half a century produce a corruption and a
decadence in men more destructive than the worst of
wars. I believe that one should act in regard to war&mdash;that
criminal law of humanity&mdash;as in regard to all
criminal laws: modify it, or endeavor to make its
execution as rare as possible, and use every means in
our power to render it superfluous. But experience of
all history teaches us that it cannot be suppressed, so
long as there shall be found on earth two men, bread,
money, and a woman between them. I should be very
glad if the Congress could prove to me the contrary;
but I doubt if it can disprove history, and the law
of God and of nature.&mdash;Accept my assurance, etc.,</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">"E. M. de Vogüé."</span>
</p>

<p>This may be summed up as follows: History and
nature, God and man, show us that so long as there
are two men left on earth, and the stakes are bread,
money, and woman, just so long there will be war.
That is, that no amount of civilization will ever destroy
that abnormal concept of life which makes it impossible
for men to divide bread, money (of all absurdities), and
woman without a fight. It is odd that people meet in
congresses and hold forth as to the best method of
catching birds by putting salt on their tails, although
they must know that this can never be done! It is
astonishing that men like Rod, Maupassant, and others,
clearly realizing all the horrors of war, and all the
contradictions that ensue from men not doing what they
ought to do, and what it would be to their advantage to
do, who bemoan the tragedy of life, and yet fail to see
that this tragic element would vanish as soon as men
ceased to discuss a subject which should not be discussed,
and ceased to do that which is both painful and
repulsive for them to do!</p>

<p>One may wonder at them; but men who, like Vogüé<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
and others, believe in the law of evolution, and look
upon war as not only unavoidable, but even useful, and
therefore desirable,&mdash;such men are fairly shocking,
horrible in their moral aberration. The former at least
declare that they hate evil and love good, but the latter
believe there is neither good nor evil.</p>

<p>All this discussion of the possibility of establishing
peace instead of continual warfare is but the mischievous
sentimentalism of idle talkers. There is a law
of evolution which seems to prove that I must live and
do wrong. What, then, can I do? I am an educated
man,&mdash;I am familiar with the doctrine of evolution;
hence it follows that I shall work evil. "Entrons au
palais de la guerre." There is a law of evolution, and
therefore there can be no real evil; and one must live
one's life and leave the rest to the law of evolution.
This is the last expression of refined civilization; it is
with this idea that the educated classes at the present
day deaden their conscience.</p>

<p>The desire of these classes to preserve their favorite
theories and the life that they have built up on them
can go no further. They lie, and by their specious
arguments deceive themselves as well as others, obscuring
and deadening their intuitive perceptions.</p>

<p>Rather than adapt their lives to their consciousness,
they try by every means to befog and to silence it. But
the light shines in the darkness, and even now it begins
to dawn.</p>

<h3>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE MILITARY CONSCRIPTION</h3>

any basis&mdash;Hence it is more advantageous for man to rebel against
the demands of the State than to submit to them.</p></blockquote>


<p>The efforts which the educated men of the upper
classes are making to silence the growing consciousness
that the present system of life must be changed, are
constantly on the increase, while life itself, continuing
to develop and to become more complex without changing
its direction, as it increases the incongruities and
suffering of human existence, brings men to the extreme
limit of this contradiction. An example of this uttermost
limit is found in the general military conscription.</p>

<p>It is usually supposed that this conscription, together
with the increasing armaments and the consequent increase
of the taxes and national debts of all countries,
are the accidental results of a certain crisis in European
affairs, which might be obviated by certain political
combinations, without change of the interior life.</p>

<p>This is utterly erroneous. The general conscription
is nothing but an internal contradiction which has crept
into the social life-conception, and which has only become
evident because it has arrived at its utmost limits
at a period when men have attained a certain degree of
material development.</p>

<p>The social life-conception transfers the significance of
life from the individual to mankind in general, through
the unbroken continuity of the family, the tribe, and
the State.</p>

<p>According to the social life-conception it is supposed
that as the significance of life is comprised in the sum
total of mankind, each individual will of his own accord
sacrifice his interests to those of the whole. This in fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
has always been the case with certain aggregates, like
the family or the tribe.</p>

<p>In consequence of custom, transmitted by education
and confirmed by religious suggestion, and without
compulsion, the individual merges his interests in those
of the group, and sacrifices himself for the benefit of the
whole.</p>

<p>But the more complex became societies, the larger
they grew,&mdash;conquest especially contributing to unite
men in social organizations,&mdash;the more individuals
would be found striving to attain their ends at the expense
of their fellow-men; and thus the necessity for
subjugation by power, or, in other words, by violence,
became more and more frequent.</p>

<p>The advocates of the social life-conception usually
attempt to combine the idea of authority, otherwise
violence, with that of moral influence; but such a union
is utterly impossible.</p>

<p>The result of moral influence upon man is to change
his desires, so that he willingly complies with what is
required of him. A man who yields to moral influence
takes pleasure in conforming his actions to its laws;
whereas authority, as the word is commonly understood,
is a means of coercion, by which a man is forced to act
in opposition to his wishes. A man who submits to
authority does not do as he pleases, he yields to compulsion,
and in order to force a man to do something
for which he has an aversion, the threat of physical
violence, or violence itself, must be employed: he may
be deprived of his liberty, flogged, mutilated, or he
may be threatened with these punishments. And this
is what constitutes power both in the past and in the
present.</p>

<p>Despite the unremitting efforts of rulers to conceal
these facts, and to attribute a different significance to
authority, it simply means the rope and chain wherewith
a man is bound and dragged, the lash wherewith
he is flogged, the knife or ax wherewith his limbs,
nose, ears, and head are hewed off. Authority is either
the menace or the perpetration of these acts. This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the practice in the times of Nero and Genghis Khan,
and is still in force even in the most liberal governments,
like the republics of France and America. If
men submit to authority, it is only because they fear
that if they were to resist, they would be subjected to
violence. All the requisitions of the State, such as the
payment of taxes and the fulfilment of public duties,
the submission to penalties in the form of exile, fines,
etc., to which men seem to yield voluntarily, are always
enforced by the physical threat or the reality of physical
punishment.</p>

<p>Physical violence is the basis of authority.</p>

<p>It is the military organization that makes it possible
to inflict physical violence, that organization wherein
the entire armed force acts as one man, obeying a
single will. This assemblage of armed men, submitting
to one will, forms what is called an army. The army
has ever been and still is the basis of an authority,
vested in the commanding generals; and the most engrossing
interest of every sovereign, from the Roman
Cæsars to the Russian and German emperors, has
always been to protect and flatter the army, for they
realize that when the army is on their side, power is
also in their hands.</p>

<p>It is the drilling and the increase of the troops required
for the maintenance of authority which has brought into
the social life-conception an element of dissolution.</p>

<p>The aim of authority, and its consequent justification,
is to restrain those men who are endeavoring, by
methods which are detrimental to those of mankind in
general, to promote their own interests. But whether
authority has been acquired by force of arms, or by
hereditary succession, or by election, men who have
gained authority are in no way different from their
fellow-men; they are just like all others, not inclined
to waive their own interests in favor of the many, but,
since they hold power in their hands, are more likely
to make the interests of the many give way to their
own. Whatever measures may have been devised by
way of restraining those in authority who might seek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
their own ends at the expense of the public, or to vest
authority in the hands of infallible men, no satisfactory
results have as yet been attained.</p>

<p>Attributing divine right to kings, hereditary succession,
election; congresses, parliaments, and senates;&mdash;none
of these have ever yet proved effectual. Everybody
knows that no expedient has ever succeeded either
in committing authority into the hands of infallible men,
or of preventing its abuses. On the contrary, we know
that men who have the authority, be they emperors,
ministers of State, chiefs of police, or even policemen,
always are more liable, because of their position, to become
immoral,&mdash;that is, to put their own private interests
before those of the public,&mdash;than men who do
not possess such an authority; and this is inevitable.</p>

<p>The social life-conception could be justified only
while all men voluntarily sacrificed their private interests
to those of the public in general; but no sooner
did men appear who refused to sacrifice their interests,
than authority, in other words, violence, was required to
restrain these men. Thus there entered into the social
life-conception, and the organization based on it, a principle
containing within itself the germs of dissolution,&mdash;the
principle of authority, or the tyranny of the few
over the many. In order that the authority held by
certain men might fulfil its object, which is to restrain
those who are trying to further their own interests to
the detriment of society in general, it would be necessary
to have it in the hands of infallible men, as is
supposed to be the case in China, or as it was believed
to be in the Middle Ages, and is even at the present
time by those who have faith in consecration by unction.
It is only under such conditions that the social organization
can be justified.</p>

<p>But as no such conditions exist, and, furthermore, as
men who are in authority, from the very fact of its
possession, must ever be far from being saints, the
social organization that is based upon authority cannot
possibly have any justification.</p>

<p>If there ever was a time when a low standard of morality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and the general tendency of men toward violence,
called for an authority possessing the power to restrict
this violence, an authority whose existence may have been
an advantage,&mdash;that is, when the violence of the State
was less than the violence of individuals toward each
other,&mdash;we cannot help seeing now that this prerogative
of the State, when violence no longer exists, cannot go on
forever. Morals improved in proportion to the gradual
decrease of individual violence, while the prerogative of
authority lost ground in measure as it became corrupted
by the possession of unbridled power.</p>

<p>The entire history of the last 2000 years will have
been told when we have described this change in the
relations between the moral development of man and the
demoralization of governments. In its simplest form it
runs thus: men lived together in tribes, in families, and
in races, and were at enmity one with another; they
employed violence, they spread desolation, they murdered
one another. Thus devastation was on a scale
both great and small: man fought with man, tribe with
tribe, family with family, race with race, nation with
nation. The larger and more powerful communities absorbed
the weaker ones; and the greater and more vigorous
became the aggregation of men, the more seldom
did one hear of acts of violence within these communities,
and the more secure the continuity of their existence
appeared.</p>

<p>When the members of a tribe or a family unite together
to form one community, they are naturally less
hostile to each other, and the tribes and families are not
so likely to die out; while among the citizens of a State
subjected to one authority the contentions seem even less
frequent, and hence is the life of the State on a basis
still more assured.</p>

<p>These fusions into larger and larger aggregates took
place, not because men realized that it would be to their
advantage, as is illustrated by the fable that tells of the
falling of the Varegs in Russia, but are due rather to
natural growth on the one hand, and struggle and conquest
on the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>When conquest was achieved, the authority of the conqueror
put an end to internal strife, and the social life-conception
was justified. But this justification is only
temporary. Internal feuds cease only when the pressure
of authority is brought to bear with greater weight upon
individuals formerly inimical to one another. The violence
of the internal struggle, not annihilated by authority,
is the offspring of authority itself. Authority is in
the hands of men who, like all the rest, are ever ready to
sacrifice the common weal if their own personal interests
are at stake; with the sole difference that these men,
encountering no resistance from the oppressed, are
wholly subject to the corrupting influence of authority
itself.</p>

<p>Therefore it is that the evil principle of violence relegated
to authority is ever increasing, and the evil becomes
in time worse than that which it is supposed to
control: whereas, in the individual members of society,
the inclination to violence is always diminishing, and
the violence of authority becomes less and less necessary.</p>

<p>As its power increases in measure of its duration, State
authority, though it may eradicate internal violence, introduces
into life other and new forms of violence, always
increasing in intensity. And though the violence of
authority in the State is less striking than that of individual
members of society toward each other, its principal
manifestation being not that of strife, but of
oppression, it exists none the less, and in the highest
degree.</p>

<p>It cannot be otherwise; for not only does the possession
of authority corrupt men, but, either from design
or unconsciously, rulers are always striving to reduce
their subjects to the lowest degree of weakness,&mdash;for
the more feeble the subject, the less the effort required
to subdue him.</p>

<p>Therefore violence employed against the oppressed
is pushed to its utmost limit, just stopping short of killing
the hen that lays the golden egg. But if the hen
has ceased to lay, like the American Indians, the Fiji<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Islanders, or the Negroes, then it is killed, despite the
sincere protests of the philanthropists against that mode
of procedure.</p>

<p>The most conclusive proof of this assertion, at the
present time, is the position of the working-men, who
are in truth simply vanquished men.</p>

<p>Despite all the pretended efforts of the upper classes
to lighten their position, all the working-men of the
world are subjected to an immutable iron rule, which
prescribes that they shall have scarcely enough to live
upon, in order that their necessities may urge them to
unremitting toil, the fruits of which are to be enjoyed
by their masters, in other words, their conquerors.</p>

<p>It has always been the case that, after the long continuance
and growth of power, the advantages accruing
to those who have submitted to it have failed, while the
disadvantages have multiplied.</p>

<p>Thus it is and thus it always has been, under whatsoever
form of government the nation may have lived;
only that where despotism prevails authority is confined
to a limited number of oppressors, and violence takes
on a ruder form, while in the constitutional monarchies,
and in the republics of France and America, authority
is distributed among a greater number of oppressors, and
its manifestations are less rude; but the result, in which
the disadvantages of dominion are greater than the advantages,
and the method&mdash;reduction of the oppressed
to the lowest possible degree of abjection, for the benefit
of the oppressors, remain ever the same.</p>

<p>Such has been the position of all the oppressed, but
until lately they have been unaware of the fact, and for
the most part have innocently believed that governments
were instituted for their benefit, to preserve them from
destruction, and that to permit the idea that men might
live without governments would be a thought sacrilegious
beyond expression; it would be the doctrine of
anarchy, with all its attendant horrors.</p>

<p>Men believed, as in something so thoroughly proved
that it needed no further testimony, that as all nations
had hitherto developed into the State form, this was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
remain the indispensable condition for the development
of mankind forever.</p>

<p>And so it has gone on for hundreds, nay, thousands
of years, and the governments, that is to say, their
representatives, have endeavored, and still go on endeavoring,
to preserve this delusion among the people.</p>

<p>As it was during the time of the Roman emperors, so
it is now. Although the idea of the uselessness, and
even of the detriment, of power enters more and more
into the consciousness of men, it might endure forever,
if governments did not think it necessary to increase
the armies in order to support their authority.</p>

<p>It is the popular belief that governments increase
armies as a means of defense against other nations,
forgetting that troops are principally needed by governments
to protect them against their own enslaved
subjects.</p>

<p>This has always been necessary, and has grown more
so with the spread of education, the increase of intercourse
among different nationalities; and at the present
time, in view of the communist, socialist, anarchist, and
labor movements, it is a more urgent necessity than ever.
Governments realize this fact, and increase their principal
means of defense,&mdash;the disciplined army.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>It was but recently that in the German Reichstag, in
giving the reason why more money was needed to increase
the pay of the subaltern officers, the German
Chancellor answered candidly that trusty subaltern officers
are needed in order to fight against socialism.
Caprivi put into words what every one knows, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
it has been carefully concealed from the people. The
reason why the Swiss and Scottish Guards were hired
to protect the popes and the French kings, and why
the Russian regiments are so carefully shuffled, is in
order that those which are posted in the interior may
be recruited by men from the borders, and those on the
borders by men from the interior. The meaning of
Caprivi's reply, translated into simple, everyday language,
means that money is needed, not to repel a
foreign enemy, but to bribe the subaltern officers to
hold themselves in readiness to act against the oppressed
working-men.</p>

<p>Caprivi incidentally expressed what every man knows&mdash;or
if he does not know it he feels it&mdash;namely, that the
existing system of life is such as it is, not because it is
natural for it to be so, or that the people are content to
have it so, but because violence on the part of governments,
the army, with its bribed subaltern officers, its
captains and generals, sustains it.</p>

<p>If a working-man has no land, if he is not allowed to
enjoy the natural right possessed by every man, to draw
from the soil the means of subsistence for himself and
his family, it is not so because the people oppose it, but
because the right to grant or to withhold this privilege
from working-men is given to certain individuals&mdash;namely,
to the landed proprietors. And this unnatural
order of things is maintained by the troops. If the
enormous wealth earned and saved by working-men is
not regarded as common property, but as something to
be enjoyed by the chosen few; if certain men are invested
with the power of levying taxes on labor, and
with the right of using that money for whatsoever purposes
they deem necessary; if the strikes of the working-men
are suppressed, and the trusts of the capitalists are
encouraged; if certain men are allowed to choose in the
matter of religious and civil education and the instruction
of children; if to certain others the right is given
to frame laws which all men must obey, and if they are
to enjoy the control of human life and property,&mdash;all
this is not because the people wish it, or because it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
come about in the course of nature, but because the governments
will have it so for their own advantage and
that of the ruling classes; and all this is accomplished
by means of physical violence.</p>

<p>If every man is not yet aware of this, he will find it
out whenever attempts are made to change the present
order of things.</p>

<p>And therefore all the governments and the ruling
classes stand in need of troops above all things, in order
to maintain a system of life which, far from having
developed from the needs of the people, is often detrimental
to them, and is only advantageous for the
government and the ruling classes.</p>

<p>Every government requires troops to enforce obedience,
that it may profit by the labor of its subjects. But
no government exists alone: side by side with it stands
the government of the adjacent country, which is also
profiting by the enforced labor of its subjects, and ever
ready to pounce upon its neighbor and take possession
of the goods which it has won from the labor of its own
subjects. Hence it is that every government needs an
army, not only for home use, but to guard its plunder
from foreign depredations. Thus each government finds
itself obliged to outdo its neighbor in the increase of its
army, and, as Montesquieu said one hundred and fifty
years ago, the expansion of armies is a veritable contagion.</p>

<p>One State makes additions to its army in order to
overawe its own subjects; its neighbor takes alarm, and
straightway follows the example.</p>

<p>Armies have reached the millions which they now number
not only from the fear of foreign invasion; the increase
was first caused by the necessity for putting down
all attempts at rebellion on the part of the subjects of
the State. The causes for the expansion of armies are
contemporary, the one depending on the other; armies
are needed against internal attempts at revolt, as well
as for external defense. The one depends upon the other.
The despotism of governments increases exactly in proportion
to the increase of their strength and their internal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
successes, and their foreign aggression with the
increase of internal despotism.</p>

<p>European governments try to outdo one another, ever
increasing their armaments, and compelled at last to
adopt the expedient of a general conscription as a means
of enrolling the greatest number of troops at the smallest
possible expense.</p>

<p>Germany was the first to whom this plan suggested
itself. And no sooner was it done by one nation than
all the others were forced to do likewise. Thus all the
citizens took up arms to assist in upholding the wrongs
that were committed against them; in fact, they became
their own oppressors.</p>

<p>General military conscription was the inevitable and
logical consummation at which it was but natural to
arrive; at the same time it is the last expression of the
innate contradiction of the social life-conception which
sprang into existence when violence was required for its
support.</p>

<p>General military conscription made this contradiction
a conspicuous fact. Indeed, the very significance of the
social life-conception consists in this,&mdash;that a man, realizing
the cruelty of the struggle of individuals among themselves,
and the peril that the individual incurs, seeks
protection by transferring his private interests to a social
community; whereas the result of the system of conscription
is that men, after having made every sacrifice
to escape from the cruel struggle and uncertainties of
life, are once more called upon to undergo all the dangers
they had hoped to escape, and moreover, the community&mdash;the
State for which the individuals gave up
their previous advantages&mdash;is now exposed to the same
risk of destruction from which the individual himself
formerly suffered. Governments should have set men
free from the cruelty of the personal struggle, and given
them confidence in the inviolable structure of State life;
but instead of doing this they impose on individuals a
repetition of the same dangers, with this difference, that
in the place of struggle between individuals of the same
group, it is a case of struggle between groups.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>The establishment of a general military conscription
is like the work of a man who props a crumbling house.
The walls have settled, sloping inward&mdash;he braces them;
the ceiling begins to hang down&mdash;he supports that; and
when the boards between give way, other braces are supplied.
At last it reaches the point when, although the
braces hold the house together, they actually make it
uninhabitable.</p>

<p>The same may be said of the general conscription
system. The general military conscription nullifies all
those advantages of social life which it is expected to
protect.</p>

<p>The advantages of social life are those guarantees
which it offers for the protection of property and labor,
as well as coöperation for the purposes of mutual advantage;
the general military conscription destroys all
this.</p>

<p>The taxes collected from the people for purposes of
war absorb the greater part of the productions of their
labor, which the army ought to protect.</p>

<p>When men are taken from the ordinary avocations of
daily life, labor is practically destroyed. Where war is
ever threatening to break forth, it does not seem worth
while to improve social conditions.</p>

<p>If a man had formerly been told that unless he submitted
to the civil authority he would run the risk of
being assaulted by wicked men, that he would be in
danger from domestic as well as from foreign foes,
against whom he would be forced to defend himself,
that he might be murdered, and therefore he would find
it for his advantage to suffer certain privations if by that
means he succeeded in escaping all these perils, he might
have believed this, especially as the sacrifices required
by the State promised him the hope of a peaceful existence
within the well-established community in whose
name he had made them. But now, when these sacrifices
are not only multiplied, but the promised advantages are
not realized, it is quite natural for men to think that
their subjection to authority is utterly useless.</p>

<p>But the fatal significance of the general conscription,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
as the manifestation of that contradiction which dwells
in the social life-conception, lies not in this. Wherever
military conscription exists, every citizen who becomes
a soldier likewise becomes a supporter of the State
system, and a participant in whatsoever the State may
do, at the same time that he does not acknowledge its
validity; and this may be called its chief manifestation.</p>

<p>Governments declare that armies are principally required
for external defense; but this is untrue. They
are, in the first place, needed to overawe their own subjects,
and every man who yields to military conscription
becomes an involuntary participator in all the oppressive
acts of government toward its subjects. It is necessary
to remember what goes on in every State in the name
of order and the welfare of the community, all the while
enforced by military authority, to be convinced that
every man who fulfils military duty becomes a participant
in acts of the State of which he cannot approve.
Every dynastic and political feud, all the executions
resulting from such feuds, the crushing of rebellions,
the use of the military in dispersing mobs, in putting
down strikes, all extortionate taxation, the injustice of
land ownership and the limitations of freedom of labor,&mdash;all
this is done, if not directly by the troops, then by
the police supported by the troops. He who performs
his military duty becomes a participant in all these acts,
about which he often feels more than dubious, and which
are in most cases directly opposed to his conscience.
Men do not wish to leave the land which they have tilled
for generations; they do not wish to disperse on the
bidding of the government; they do not wish to pay the
taxes which are extorted from them; neither do they
willingly submit to laws which they have not helped to
make; they do not wish to give up their nationality.
And I, if I am performing military duty, must come
forward and strike these men down. I cannot take part
in such proceedings without asking myself if they be
right. And ought I to coöperate in carrying them
out?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>General military conscription is the last step in the
process of coercion required by governments for the support
of the whole structure; for subjects it is the extreme
limit of obedience. It is the keystone of the
arch that supports the walls, the abstraction of which
would destroy the whole fabric. The time has come
when the ever growing abuses of governments, and their
mutual contests, have required from all their subjects not
only material but moral sacrifices, till each man pauses
and asks himself, Can I make these sacrifices? And
for whose sake am I to make them? These sacrifices
are demanded in the name of the State. In the name
of the State I am asked to give up all that makes life
dear to a man,&mdash;peace, family, safety, and personal
dignity. What, then, is this State in whose name such
appalling sacrifices are demanded? And of what use
is it?</p>

<p>We are told that the State is necessary, in the first
place, because were it not for that no man would be safe
from violence and the attacks of wicked men; in the
second place, without the State we should be like savages,
possessing neither religion, morals, education,
instruction, commerce, means of communication, nor
any other social institutions; and, in the third place,
because without the State we should be subject to the
invasion of the neighboring nations.</p>

<p>"Were it not for the State," we are told, "we should
be subjected to violence and to the attacks of evil men
in our own land."</p>

<p>But who are these evil men from whose violence and
attacks the government and the army saves us? If such
men existed three or four centuries ago, when men prided
themselves on their military skill and strength of arm,
when a man proved his valor by killing his fellow-men,
we find none such at the present time: men of our time
neither use nor carry weapons, and, believing in the
precepts of humanity and pity for their neighbors, they
are as desirous for peace and a quiet life as we are
ourselves. Hence this extraordinary class of marauders,
against whom the State might defend us, no longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
exists. But if, when they speak of the men from whose
attacks the government defends us, we understand that
they mean the criminal classes, in that case we know
that they are not extraordinary beings, like beasts of
prey among sheep, but are men very much like ourselves,
who are naturally just as reluctant to commit
crimes as those against whom they commit them. We
know now that threats and punishments are powerless
to decrease the numbers of such men, but that their
numbers may be decreased by change of environment
and by moral influence. Hence the theory of the necessity
of State violence in order to protect mankind against
evil-doers, if it had any foundation three or four centuries
ago, has none whatever at the present time. One
might say quite the reverse nowadays, for the activity
of governments, with their antiquated and merciless
methods of punishment, their galleys, prisons, gallows,
and guillotines, so far below the general plane of morality,
tends rather to lower the standard of morals than to
elevate it, and therefore rather to increase than to lessen
the number of criminals.</p>

<p>It is said that "without the State there would be no
institutions, educational, moral, religious, or international;
there would be no means of communication.
Were it not for the State, we should be without organizations
necessary to all of us."</p>

<p>An argument like this could only have had a basis
several centuries ago. If there ever was a time when
men had so little international communication, and were
so unused to intercourse or interchange of thought that
they could not come to an agreement on matters of
general interest&mdash;commercial, industrial, or economical&mdash;without
the assistance of the State, such is not the
case at present. The widely diffused means of communication
and transmission of thought have achieved
this result,&mdash;that when the modern man desires to found
societies, assemblies, corporations, congresses, scientific,
economical, or political institutions, not only can
he easily dispense with the assistance of governments,
but in the majority of cases governments are more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
of a hindrance than a help in the pursuit of such objects.</p>

<p>Since the end of the last century almost every progressive
movement on the part of mankind has been not
only discouraged, but invariably hampered, by governments.
Such was the case with the abolition of corporal
punishment, torture, and slavery; with the establishment
of freedom of the press and liberty of meeting. Furthermore,
State authorities and governments nowadays not
only do not coöperate, but they directly hinder the
activity by means of which men work out new forms
of life. The solution of labor and land questions, of
political and religious problems, is not only unencouraged,
but distinctly opposed, by the government authority.</p>

<p>"If there were no State and government authority,
nations would be subjugated by their neighbors."</p>

<p>It is not worth while to answer this last argument.
It refutes itself.</p>

<p>We are told that the government and its armies are
necessary for our defense against the neighboring States
which might subject us. But all the governments say
this of one another; and yet we know that every European
nation professes the same principles of liberty and
fraternity, and therefore needs no defense against its
neighbor. But if one speaks of defense against barbarians,
then one per cent of the troops under arms at
the present time would suffice. It is not only that the
increase of armed force fails to protect us from danger
of attack from our neighbors, it actually provokes the
very attack which it deprecates.</p>

<p>Hence no man who reflects on the significance of the
State, in whose name he is required to sacrifice his
peace, his safety, and his life, can escape the conviction
that there is no longer any reasonable ground for such
sacrifices.</p>

<p>Even regarding the subject theoretically, a man must
realize that the sacrifices demanded by the State are
without sufficient reason; and when he considers the
matter from a practical point of view, weighing all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
different conditions in which he has been placed by the
State, every man must see that so far as he himself is
concerned, the fulfilment of the requirements of the State
and his own subjection to military conscription is indubitably
and in every case less advantageous for him than
if he refused to comply with it. If the majority of
people prefer obedience to insubordination, it is not
because they have given the subject dispassionate consideration,
weighing the advantages and disadvantages,
but because they are, so to speak, under the influence
of hypnotic suggestion. Men submit to demands like
this without using their reason or making the least effort
of the will. It requires independent reasoning, as well
as effort, to refuse submission,&mdash;effort which some
men are incapable of making. But supposing we exclude
the moral significance of submission and non-submission,
and consider only their advantages, then
non-submission will always prove more advantageous
than submission. Whoever I may be, whether I belong
to the well-to-do&mdash;the oppressing class&mdash;or to the oppressed
laboring class, in either case the disadvantages
of non-submission are less numerous than the disadvantages
of submission, and the advantages of non-submission
greater than those of submission.</p>

<p>If I belong to the oppressive, which is the smallest
class, and refuse to submit to the demands of the
government, I shall be tried as one who refuses to fulfil
his obligations,&mdash;I shall be tried, and in case my
trial terminates favorably, I shall either be declared not
guilty, or I may be dealt with as they treat the Mennonites
in Russia&mdash;that is, be compelled to serve my
term of military service by performing some non-military
work; if, on the contrary, an unfavorable verdict
is rendered, I shall be condemned to exile or imprisonment
for two or three years (I am speaking of cases in
Russia); or possibly my term of imprisonment may be
longer. And I may even be condemned to suffer the
penalty of death, although that is not at all probable.
Such are the disadvantages of non-submission.</p>

<p>The disadvantages of submission are as follows:&mdash;If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
I am fortunate I shall not be sent to murder men,
neither shall I run the risk myself of being disabled or
killed; they will simply make a military slave of me.
I shall be arrayed in the garments of a clown; my
superior officers, from the corporal to the field-marshal,
will order me about. At their word of command I shall
be put through a series of gymnastic contortions, and
after being detained from one to five years I shall be
released, but still obliged for ten years longer to hold
myself in readiness at any moment I may be summoned
to execute the orders these people give me. And if I
am less fortunate I shall be sent to the wars, still in the
same condition of slavery, and there I shall be forced
to slay fellow-men of other countries who never did me
any harm. Or I may be sent to a place where I may
be mutilated or killed; perhaps find myself, as at Sevastopol,
sent to certain death; these things happen in
every war. Worse than all things else, I may be sent
to fight against my fellow-countrymen, and compelled to
kill my own brethren for some matter dynastic or governmental,
and to me of foreign interest. Such are
the comparative disadvantages.</p>

<p>The comparative advantages of submission and non-submission
are as follows:&mdash;For him who has submitted
the advantages are these: after he has subjected
himself to all the degradations and committed all the cruel
deeds required of him, he may, provided he be not
killed, receive some scarlet or golden bauble to decorate
his clown's attire; or if he be especially favored, hundreds
of thousands of just such brutal men like himself
may be put under his command, and he be called field-marshal,
and receive large sums of money.</p>

<p>By refusing to submit he will possess the advantages
of preserving his manly dignity, of winning the respect
of good men, and, above all, he will enjoy the assurance
that he is doing God's business, and therefore an unquestionable
benefit to mankind.</p>

<p>Such are the advantages and disadvantages, on either
side, for the oppressor, a member of the wealthy class.
For a man of the working-class&mdash;a poor man&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
advantages and disadvantages are about the same, if we
include one important addition to the disadvantages.
The special disadvantage for a man of the working-class
who has not refused to perform military service is that,
when he enters the service, his participation and his tacit
consent go toward confirming the oppression in which
he finds himself.</p>

<p>But the question concerning the State, whether its
continued existence is a necessity, or whether it would
be wiser to abolish it, cannot be decided by discussion
on its usefulness for the men who are required to support
it by taking part in the military service, and still
less by weighing the comparative advantages and disadvantages
of submission or non-submission for the
individual himself. It is decided irrevocably and without
appeal by the religious consciousness, by the conscience
of each individual, to whom no sooner does
military conscription become a question than it is followed
by that of the necessity or non-necessity of the State.</p>

<h3>CERTAINTY OF THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHRISTIAN
DOCTRINE OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY VIOLENCE
BY THE MEN OF OUR WORLD</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">Christianity is not a legislation but a new life-conception; hence it was
not obligatory, nor has it been accepted by all men in its full meaning,
but only by a few; the rest have accepted it in a corrupted form&mdash;Moreover,
Christianity is a prophecy of the disappearance of the
pagan life, and therefore of the necessity of accepting the Christian
doctrine&mdash;Non-resistance of evil by violence is one of the principles
of the Christian doctrine which must inevitably be accepted by men
at the present day&mdash;Two methods of solving every struggle&mdash;The
first method consists in believing the general definitions of evil to
be binding upon all, and to resist this evil by violence&mdash;The second,
the Christian method, consists in not resisting evil by violence&mdash;Although
the failure of the first method was recognized in the first centuries
of Christianity, it is still employed; but as humanity advanced
it has become more evident that there is not, nor can there be, a general
definition of evil&mdash;Now this has become evident to all, and if the
violence which is destined to combat evil exists, it is not because it is
considered necessary, but because men do not know how to dispense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
with it&mdash;The difficulty of dispensing with it is due to the skilfulness
and complexity of political violence&mdash;This violence is supported by
four methods: by threats, bribes, hypnotism, and the employment
of military force&mdash;Deliverance from State violence cannot be accomplished
by overthrowing the State&mdash;Through experience of the
misery of pagan life men are compelled to acknowledge the doctrine
of Christ, with its non-resistance to evil,&mdash;a doctrine which they have
hitherto ignored&mdash;To this same necessity of acknowledging the Christian
doctrine we are brought by the consciousness of its truth&mdash;This
consciousness is in utter contradiction to our life, and is especially
evident in regard to general military conscription; but, in consequence
of habit and the four methods of State violence, men do not
see this inconsistency of Christianity with the duties of a soldier&mdash;Men
do not see it even when the authorities themselves show them
plainly all the immorality of the duties of a soldier&mdash;The call of the
general conscription is the extreme trial for every man,&mdash;the command
to choose between the Christian doctrine of non-resistance or servile
submission to the existing organization of the State&mdash;Men generally
submit to the demands of the State organization, renouncing all that
is sacred, as though there were no other issue&mdash;For men of the pagan
life-conception, indeed, no other issue does exist; they are compelled
to acknowledge it, regardless of all the dreadful calamities of war&mdash;Society
composed of such men must inevitably perish, and no social
changes can save it&mdash;The pagan life has reached its last limits; it
works its own destruction.</p></blockquote>


<p>It is frequently said that if Christianity be a truth,
it would have been accepted by all men on its first
appearance, and would straightway have changed and
improved the lives of men. One might as well say
that if the seed is alive it must instantly sprout and
produce its flower or its fruit.</p>

<p>The Christian doctrine is not a law which, being introduced
by violence, can forthwith change the life of
mankind. Christianity is a life-conception more lofty
and excellent than the ancient; and such a new conception
of life cannot be enforced; it must be adopted
voluntarily, and by two processes, the spiritual or interior
process, and the experimental or external process.</p>

<p>Some men there are&mdash;but the smaller proportion&mdash;who
instantly, and as though by prophetic intuition, divine
the truth, surrender themselves to its influence, and
live up to its precepts; others&mdash;and they are the
majority&mdash;are brought to the knowledge of the truth,
and the necessity for its adoption, by a long series of
errors, by experience and suffering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>It is to this necessity of adopting the doctrine by the
external process of experience that Christendom has at
last arrived.</p>

<p>Now and then one wonders why the mistaken presentment
of Christianity, which even at the present time
prevents men from accepting it in its true significance,
could have been necessary. And yet the very errors,
having brought men to their present position, have been
the medium through which it has become possible for
the majority to accept Christianity in its true meaning.</p>

<p>If instead of that corrupted form of Christianity which
was given to the people, it had been offered to them in
its purity, the greater portion of mankind would have
refused it, like the Asiatic peoples to whom it is yet
unknown. But having once accepted it in its corrupted
form, the nations embracing it were subjected to its slow
but sure influence, and by a long succession of errors,
and the suffering that ensued therefrom, have now
been brought to the necessity of adopting it in its true
meaning.</p>

<p>The erroneous presentation of Christianity, and its acceptance
by the majority of mankind, with all its errors,
was then a necessity, just as the seed, if it is to sprout,
must for a time be buried in the soil.</p>

<p>The Christian doctrine is the doctrine of truth as well
as of prophecy.</p>

<p>Eighteen hundred years ago the Christian doctrine
revealed to men the true conduct of life, and at the
same time foretold the result of disobeying its injunctions
and of continuing to pursue their former course,
guided only by the precepts which were taught before
the dawn of Christianity; and it also showed them what
life may become if they accept the Christian doctrine
and obey its dictates.</p>

<p>Having taught in the Sermon on the Mount those
precepts by which men should order their daily lives,
Christ said: "Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings
of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a
wise man, which built his house upon a rock: and the
rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it
was founded upon a rock. And every one that heareth
these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be
likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon
the sand: and the rain descended, and the floods came,
and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it
fell: and great was the fall of it" (Matthew vii. 24-27).</p>

<p>And thus, after eighteen centuries, the prophecy has
been fulfilled. As the result of the abandonment of
Christ's teachings, having disregarded the principle of
non-resistance to evil, men have unwittingly fallen into
the condition of imminent peril foretold by Christ to
those who refused to follow His precepts.</p>

<p>Men often think that the question of resistance or non-resistance
to evil by violence is an artificial question,
which may be evaded. And yet this is the question
that life presents to mankind in general, and to each
thinking man in particular, and it is one that must be
solved. In social life, ever since Christianity was first
preached, this question has been like the doubt that
confronts the traveler when he comes to a place where
the road which he has followed divides, and he knows
not which branch to choose. He must pursue his way,
and he can no longer go on without pausing to deliberate,
because there are now two roads from which to
choose, whereas before there was but one; he must
make up his mind which he will take.</p>

<p>In like manner, since the doctrine of Christ has been
made known to men, they can no longer say, I will go
on living as I did before, without deciding the question
of resistance or non-resistance to evil by violence. One
must decide at the beginning of every fresh struggle
whether one ought or ought not to resist by violence
that which one believes to be evil.</p>

<p>The question of resistance or non-resistance of evil by
violence arose with the first contest among men, for
every contest is simply the resistance by violence of
something which each combatant believes to be an evil.
But before the time of Christ men did not understand
that resistance by violence of whatever the individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
believed to be evil&mdash;only the same action which seems
evil to one man may seem good to another&mdash;is simply
one mode of settling the difficulty, and that the other
method consists in not resisting evil by violence.</p>

<p>Before the appearance of the doctrine of Christ men
believed that there could be but one way of deciding the
contest, that of resisting evil by violence, and acted accordingly,
while each combatant strove to persuade himself
and others that what he regarded as evil was in fact
the actual and absolute evil. For this purpose, dating
from the oldest times, men began to invent certain definitions
of evil which should be obligatory for all, and for
the purpose of establishing definitions which should be
thus binding, were issued, either certain laws supposed
to have been received in a supernatural manner, or commands
of individuals or of bodies of men to whom an
infallible wisdom was ascribed. Men used violence
against their fellow-men and assured themselves and
others that they were but using such violence against
an evil acknowledged by all.</p>

<p>This was the custom from the most ancient times,
particularly among men who had usurped authority, and
men have been long in seeing its baselessness.</p>

<p>But the longer mankind existed the more complex
grew its mutual relations, and the more evident it became
that to resist by violence everything that is considered
evil is unwise; that the struggle is not diminished
thereby, and that no human wisdom can ever define an
infallible standard of evil.</p>

<p>When Christianity first appeared in the Roman Empire
it had already become evident to most men that
whatever Nero or Caligula called evil, and sought to
overcome by violence, was not necessarily an evil for the
rest of mankind. Even then men had already begun to
realize that the human laws for which a divine origin
was claimed were really written by men; that men cannot
be infallible, no matter with what external authority
they may be invested; and that fallible men will not become
infallible because they meet together and call
themselves a Senate, or any other similar name. Even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
then this had been perceived and understood by many.
And it was then that Christ preached His doctrine, which
not only embodied the principle of non-resistance, but
which revealed a new conception of life, of which the
application to social life would lead to the suppression
of strife among men, not by obliging one class to yield
to whatsoever authority shall ordain, but by forbidding
all men, and especially those in power, to employ violence
against others.</p>

<p>The doctrine was at that time embraced by a very
limited number of disciples, while the majority of men,
particularly those who were in authority, although they
nominally accepted Christianity, continued to follow the
practice of resisting by violence whatever they regarded
as evil. So it was during the times of the Roman and
Byzantine emperors, and so it went on in later times.</p>

<p>The inconsistency of an authoritative definition of evil
and its resistance by violence, already apparent in the
first centuries of Christianity, had grown still more evident
at the time of the dissolution of the Roman Empire
and its subdivision into numerous independent states
hostile to one another and torn by internal dissensions.</p>

<p>But men were not yet ready to accept the law of
Christ, and the former method of defining an evil to be
resisted by the establishment of laws, enforced by coercion
and binding upon all men, continued to be employed.
The arbiter, whose office it was to decide upon
the nature of the evil to be resisted by violence, was
alternately the Emperor, the Pope, the elected body, or
the nation at large. But both within and without the
State men were always to be found who refused to hold
themselves bound, either by those laws which were supposed
to be the expression of the divine will, or by the
human laws which claimed to manifest the will of the
people;&mdash;men whose views on the subject of evil were
quite at variance with those of the existing authorities,
men who resisted the authorities, employing the same
methods of violence that had been directed against
themselves.</p>

<p>Men invested with religious authority would condemn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
as evil a matter which to men and institutions invested
with a temporal authority commended itself as desirable,
and <em>vice versa</em>, and more and more furious grew the
struggle. And the oftener men had recourse to violence
in settling the difficulty, the more evident it became that
it was ill chosen, because there is not, nor can there ever
be, a standard authority of evil to which all mankind
would agree.</p>

<p>Thus matters went on for eighteen centuries, and at
last arrived at their present condition, which is, that no
man can dispute the fact that an infallible definition of
evil will never be made. We have reached the point
when men have ceased not only to believe in the possibility
of finding a universal definition which all men will
admit, but they have even ceased to believe in the
necessity of such a definition. We have reached the
point when men in authority no longer seek to prove
that that which they consider evil is evil, but candidly
acknowledge that they consider that to be evil which
does not please them, and those who are subject to authority
obey, not because they believe that the definitions
of evil made by authority are just, but only because
they have no power to resist. The annexation of Nice
to France, Lorraine to Germany, the Czechs to Austria,
the partition of Poland, the subjection of Ireland and
India to the English rule, the waging of war against
China, the slaughter of Africans, the expulsion of the
Chinese, the persecution of the Jews in Russia, or the
derivation of profits by landowners from land which
they do not cultivate, and by capitalists from the results
of labor performed by others,&mdash;none of all this is
done because it is virtuous, or because it will benefit
mankind and is essentially opposed to evil, but because
those who hold authority will have it so. The result at
the present time is this: certain men use violence, no
longer in the name of resistance to evil, but from caprice,
or because it is for their advantage; while certain other
men submit to violence, not because they believe, like
those of former ages, that violence is used to defend
them from evil, but simply because they cannot escape it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>If a Roman, or a man of the Middle Ages, or a Russian,
such a man as I can remember fifty years ago,
believed implicitly that the existing violence of authority
was needed to save him from evil,&mdash;that taxes, duties,
serfdom, prisons, the lash, the knout, galleys, executions,
military conscription, and wars were unavoidable,&mdash;it
would be difficult to find a man at the present time who
believes that all the violences committed saves a single
man from evil; on the contrary, not one could be found
who had not a distinct assurance that most of the
violations to which he is subjected, and in which he
himself participates, are in themselves a great and unprofitable
calamity.</p>

<p>There is hardly a man to be found at the present time
who fails to realize all the uselessness and absurdity of
collecting taxes from the laboring classes for the purpose
of enriching idle officials; or the folly of punishing
weak and immoral men by exile or imprisonment, where,
supported as they are, and living in idleness, they become
still weaker and more depraved; or, again, the
unspeakable folly and cruelty of those preparations for
war, which can neither be explained nor justified, and
which ruin and imperil the safety of nations. Nevertheless
these violations continue, and the very men who
realize and even suffer from their uselessness, absurdity,
and cruelty, contribute to their encouragement.</p>

<p>If fifty years ago it was possible that the wealthy man
of leisure and the illiterate laborer should both believe
that their positions, the one a continual holiday, the
other a life of incessant labor, were ordained by God&mdash;in
these days, not only throughout Europe, and even in
Russia, owing to the activity of the people, the growth
of education, and the art of printing, it is hardly possible
to find a man, either rich or poor, who in one way or
another would not question the justice of such an order
of things. Not only do the rich realize that the possession
of wealth is in itself a fault, for which they strive
to atone by donations to science and art, as formerly
they redeemed their sins by endowing churches; but
even the majority of the laboring class now understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
that the existing order is false, and should be altered, if
not abolished. Men who profess religion, of whom we
have millions in Russia, the so-called sectarians, acknowledge,
because they interpret the gospel doctrine
correctly, that this order of things is false and should
be destroyed. The working-men consider it false because
of the socialistic, communistic, or anarchical
theories that have already found way into their ranks.
In these days the principle of violence is maintained,
not because it is considered necessary, but simply because
it has been so long in existence, and is so thoroughly
organized by those who profit by it&mdash;that is to
say, by the governments and ruling classes&mdash;that those
who are in their power find it impossible to escape.</p>

<p>Nowadays every government, the despotic as well as
the most liberal, has become what Herzen has so cleverly
termed a Genghis Khan with a telegraphic equipment,
that is, with an organization of violence, having
for basis nothing less than the most brutal tyranny, and
converting all the means invented by science for the
inter-communication and peaceful activities of free and
equal men to its own tyrannous and oppressive ends.</p>

<p>The existing governments and the ruling classes no
longer care to present even the semblance of justice,
but rely, thanks to scientific progress, on an organization
so ingenious that it is able to inclose all men within
a circle of violence through which it is impossible to
break. This circle is made up of four expedients, each
connected with and supporting the other like the rings
of a chain.</p>

<p>The first and the oldest expedient is intimidation.
It consists in representing the actual organization of the
State, whether it be that of a liberal republic or of an
arbitrary despotism, as something sacred and immutable,
which therefore punishes by the most cruel penalties
any attempt at revolution. This expedient has been
put into practice recently wherever a government exists:
in Russia against the so-called nihilists, in America
against the anarchists, in France against the imperialists,
monarchists, communists, and anarchists. Railroads,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
telegraphs, telephones, photography, the improved
method of disposing of criminals by imprisoning them
in solitary confinement for the remainder of their lives
in cells, where, hidden from human view, they die forgotten,
as well as numerous other modern inventions
upon which governments have the prior claim, give them
such power, that if once the authority fell into certain
hands, and the regular and secret police, administrative
officials, and all kinds of procureurs, jailers, and executioners
labored zealously to support it, there would be
no possibility whatsoever of overthrowing the government,
however cruel or senseless it might be.</p>

<p>The second expedient is bribery. This consists in taking
the property of the laboring classes by means of
taxation and distributing it among the officials, who, in
consideration of this, are bound to maintain and increase
the bondage of the people. The bribed officials, from
the prime ministers to the lowest scribes, form one unbroken
chain of individuals, united by a common interest,
supported by the labor of the people, fulfilling the
will of the government with a submission proportionate
to their gains, never hesitating to use any means in any
department of business to promote the action of that
governmental violence on which their well-being rests.</p>

<p>The third expedient I can call by no other name than
hypnotism. It consists in retarding the spiritual development
of men, and, by means of various suggestions,
influencing them to cling to the theory of life which
mankind has already left behind, and upon which rests
the foundation of governmental authority. We have at
the present time a hypnotizing system, organized in a
most complex manner, beginning in childhood and continued
until the hour of death. This hypnotism begins
during the early years of a man's life in a system of
compulsory education. Children receive in school the
same ideas in regard to the universe which their ancestors
entertained, and which are in direct contradiction
to contemporary knowledge. In countries where
a State religion exists, children are taught the senseless
and sacrilegious utterances of church catechisms, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the duty of obedience to authorities; in the republics
they are taught the absurd superstition of patriotism,
and the same obligation of obedience to the government.
In maturer years this hypnotizing process is continued
by the encouragement of religious and patriotic superstition.
Religious superstition is encouraged by the erection
of churches built from money collected from the
people, by holidays, processions, painting, architecture,
music, by incense that stupefies the brain, and, above all,
by the maintenance of the so-called clergy, whose duty
consists in befogging the minds of men and keeping
them in a continual state of imbecility, what with the
solemnity of their services, their sermons, their intervention
with the private lives of men in time of marriage,
birth, and death. The patriotic superstition is encouraged
by the governments and the ruling classes by instituting
national festivals, spectacles, and holidays, by
erecting monuments with money collected from the people,
which will influence men to believe in the exclusive
importance and greatness of their own State or country
and its rulers, and encourage a feeling of hostility and
even of hatred toward other nations. Furthermore,
autocratic governments directly forbid the printing and
circulation of books and the delivery of speeches that
might enlighten men; and those teachers who have the
power to rouse the people from its torpor are either
banished or imprisoned. And every government, without
exception, conceals from the masses all that would
tend to set them free, and encourages all that would
demoralize them,&mdash;all those writings, for instance, that
tend to confirm them in the crudeness of their religious
and patriotic superstition; all kinds of sensual pleasures,
shows, circuses, theaters; and all means for producing
physical stupor, especially those, like tobacco or brandy,
which are among the principal sources of national income.
Even prostitution is encouraged; it is not only
recognized, but organized by the majority of governments.
Such is the third expedient.</p>

<p>The fourth expedient consists in this: certain individuals
are selected from among the mass of enslaved and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
stupefied beings, and these, after having been subjected
to a still more vigorous process of brutalization, are made
the passive instruments of the cruelties and brutalities
indispensable to the government. This state of brutality
and imbecility is produced by taking men in their youth,
before they have yet had time to gain any clear conception
of morality; and then, having removed them from
all the natural conditions of human life, from home,
family, birthplace, and the possibility of intelligent labor,
by shutting them up together in barracks, where, dressed
in a peculiar uniform, to the accompaniment of shouts,
drums, music, and the display of glittering gewgaws,
they are daily forced to perform certain prescribed evolutions.
By these methods they are reduced to that
hypnotic condition when they cease to be men and become
imbecile and docile machines in the hands of the
hypnotizer. These physically strong young men thus
hypnotized (and at the present time, with the general
conscription system, all young men answer to this description),
supplied with murderous weapons, ever obedient
to the authority of the government, and ready at
its command to commit any violence whatsoever, constitute
the fourth and the principal means for subjugating
men. So the circle of violence is completed.</p>

<p>Intimidation, bribery, and hypnotism force men to
become soldiers; soldiers give power and make it
possible to execute and to rob mankind (with the aid of
bribed officials), as well as to hypnotize and to recruit
men who are in their turn to become soldiers.</p>

<p>The circle is complete, and there is no possibility of
escape from it.</p>

<p>If some men believe that deliverance from violence,
or even a certain abatement of its energy, may be the
result of its overthrow by the oppressed, who will then
replace it by a system which will require no such
violence and subjugation, and if, so believing, they
attempt to bring this about, they only deceive themselves
and others. So far from improving the position,
these attempts will only render things worse.</p>

<p>The activity of such men only strengthens the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
despotism of governments by giving the latter a convenient
pretext for increasing their defenses. For even
when, following a train of circumstances highly demoralizing
to the government,&mdash;take the case of France
in 1870, for example,&mdash;a government is overthrown by
violence and the authority passes into other hands, this
new authority is by no means likely to be less oppressive
than the former. On the contrary, obliged to
defend itself from its exasperated and overthrown
enemies, it will be even more cruel and despotic than
its predecessor, as has ever been the case in periods of
revolution.</p>

<p>If socialists and communists believe that the possession
of individual capital is a pernicious influence in society,
and anarchists regard government itself as an evil, there
are, on the other hand, monarchists, conservatives, and
capitalists who look upon the social and communal
state as an evil order of society, no less than anarchy
itself; and all these parties have nothing better to offer
by way of reconciling mankind than violence. Thus,
whichever party gains the upper hand, it will be forced,
in order to introduce and maintain its own system, not
only to avail itself of all former methods of violence,
but to invent new ones as well. It simply means a
change of slavery with new victims and a new organization;
but the violence will remain,&mdash;nay, increase,&mdash;because
human hatred, intensified by the struggle, will
devise new means for reducing the conquered to subjection.
This has always been the result of every revolution
and violent overthrow of government. Each
struggle serves but to increase the power of those in
authority at the time to enslave their fellow-men.</p>

<p>One domain of human activity, and only one, has
hitherto escaped the encroachments of the governments&mdash;the
domain of the family, the economical domain of
private life and domestic labor. But now even this
domain, in consequence of the struggle of socialists
and communists, is gradually passing into the hands
of the governments, so that labor and recreation, the
dwellings, clothes, and food of the people will by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
degrees, if the desires of the reformers are accomplished,
be determined and regulated by the government.</p>

<p>The long experiment of Christian life by nation after
nation, during eighteen centuries, has inevitably brought
men to the necessity of deciding whether the doctrine
of Christ is to be accepted or refused, and of deciding,
too, the question of social life dependent thereupon,&mdash;the
resistance or non-resistance of evil by violence.
But there is this difference,&mdash;that formerly men could
either accept or reject the decision given by Christianity,
whereas now it has become imperative, because it
affords the sole means of deliverance from that condition
of slavery in which, as in a net, men find themselves
entangled.</p>

<p>Nor is it alone this sad plight that brings them to
this necessity.</p>

<p>Parallel with the negative proof of the falsehood of
the pagan order of things there has been positive proof
of the truth of the Christian doctrine.</p>

<p>Indeed, in the course of the eighteen centuries, the
best men in all Christendom, through an inner spiritual
medium, having recognized the truths of the doctrine,
have borne witness of it, regardless of threats, privations,
miseries, and torture. These nobler men, by their
martyrdom, have sealed the truth of the doctrine.</p>

<p>Christianity penetrated into human consciousness,
not alone by the method of negative proof, that, namely,
it had become impossible to go on with the pagan life;
but by its simplifying process, by its explanation of, and
its deliverance from, superstition, and by its consequent
spread among all classes of society.</p>

<p>Eighteen centuries of the profession of Christianity
have not passed in vain for those who accepted it, even if
it were but in outward form. These eighteen centuries
have made men realize all the miseries of the pagan state,
even though they have continued to lead a pagan existence,
out of harmony with an age of humanity; and at
the bottom of their hearts they believe now (and herein
lies the only reason for living at all) that salvation from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
such an existence can be found in the fulfilment of the
Christian doctrine in its true sense. As to when and
where this salvation is to be accomplished, opinions
differ, according to the intellectual development of men
and the prejudices among which they live; but every
educated man recognizes that our salvation is to be
found in the fulfilment of the Christian doctrine.
Certain believers, those who consider the Christian
doctrine divine, affirm that this salvation will be accomplished
when all men believe in Christ and the time of
the second advent approaches; others, who also have
faith in the divinity of Christ's doctrine, believe that
this salvation will come through the churches, which,
having got all men within the fold, will implant in their
hearts those Christian virtues which will transform their
lives. Others, again, who do not accept the divinity of
Christ, believe that the salvation of men will be accomplished
by means of a slow, continuous progress, during
which the groundwork of pagan life will be gradually
replaced by the groundwork of liberty, equality, and
fraternity&mdash;that is, by the basis of Christianity. Still
others there are who preach a new social organization,
and who believe that this salvation will be brought
about when, by means of a violent revolution, men are
forced to a community of goods, to the abolition of
governments, to collective rather than individual labor&mdash;that
is, by the realization of one of the aspects of
Christianity. Thus, after one fashion or another, all
men of our epoch not only renounce the existing order
of life as no longer suited to the times, but acknowledge,
often without realizing it, and regarding themselves
as enemies of Christianity, that our salvation lies
only in the adaptation to life of a whole or a part of the
Christian doctrine in its true sense.</p>

<p>For the majority of men Christianity, as its Teacher
has expressed it, could not be comprehended at once,
but was to grow, like unto a huge tree, from the tiniest
seed. "The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of
mustard seed, ... which indeed is the least of all seeds:
but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
becometh a tree." And thus it has grown and continues
to grow, if not in manifestation, then in human consciousness.</p>

<p>It is no longer reserved for the minority of men, who
have always understood Christianity by its veritable
truth; but it is acknowledged by the great majority,
who, if we are to judge by their social life, are far
removed from it.</p>

<p>Look at the private life of individuals, listen to their
estimation of human actions as they pronounce judgment
on each other; listen not only to public sermons and
orations, but to the precepts which parents and teachers
offer to their charges, and you will see that, however far
removed from the practice of Christian truths may be
the political or social existence of men who are in bonds
to violence, yet Christian virtues are admired and exalted
by all; while, on the contrary, the anti-Christian
vices are unhesitatingly condemned as harmful to all
mankind. Those who sacrifice their lives in the service
of humanity are looked upon as the better men; while
those who take advantage of the misfortune of their
neighbors to further their own selfish interests are
universally condemned.</p>

<p>There may still be men who, insensible to Christian
ideals, have set up for themselves other ideals, such as
power, courage, or wealth; but these ideals are passing
away; they are not accepted by all, nor by the men of
the better class. Indeed, the Christian ideals are the
only ones which are recognized as obligatory for all.</p>

<p>The position of our Christian world, looked at from
without, with its cruelty and slavery, is indeed appalling.
But if we consider it from the standpoint of human consciousness,
it presents a very different aspect. All the
evil of our life seems to exist only because it always has
existed from all ages, and the men whose actions are
evil have had neither the time nor the experience to
overcome their evil habits, although all are willing to
abandon them. Evil seems to exist by reason of some
cause apparently independent of the consciousness of
men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>Strange and contradictory as it may seem, modern
men hate the very order of things which they themselves
support.</p>

<p>I believe it is Max Müller who describes the astonishment
of an Indian converted to Christianity, who, having
apprehended the essence of the Christian doctrine, came
to Europe and beheld the life of Christians. He could
not recover from his astonishment in the presence of
the reality, so different from the state of things he had
expected to find among Christian nations.</p>

<p>If we are not surprised at the contradiction between
our convictions and our actions, it is only because the
influences which obscure this contradiction act upon us.
We have but to look at our life from the standpoint of
the Indian, who understood Christianity in its true significance,
without any concessions or adaptations, and to behold
the barbarous cruelties with which our life is filled,
in order to be horrified at the contradictions in the midst
of which we live, without noticing them.</p>

<p>One has but to remember the preparations for war, the
cartridge-boxes, the silver-plated bullets, the torpedoes,
and&mdash;the Red Cross; the establishment of prisons
for solitary confinement, experiments with <em>electrocution</em>,
and&mdash;the care for the welfare of the prisoners; the
philanthropic activity of the rich, and&mdash;their daily life,
which brings about the existence of the poor, whom they
seek to benefit. And these contradictions arise, not, as it
might seem, because men pretend to be Christians while
they are actually heathens, but because they lack something,
or because there is some power which prevents
them from being what they really desire to be, and what
they even conscientiously believe themselves to be. It
is not that modern men merely pretend to hate oppression,
the inequality of class distinctions, and all kinds
of cruelty, whether practised against their fellow-men or
against animals. They <em>are</em> sincere in their hatred of
these abuses; but they do not know how to abolish
them, or they lack the courage to alter their own mode
of life, which depends upon all this, and which seems
to them so important.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>Ask, indeed, any individual if he considers it praiseworthy
or even honorable for a man to fill a position for
which he receives a salary so high as to be out of all
proportion to the amount of his labor, as, for instance,
that of collecting from the people, often from beggars,
taxes which are to be devoted to the purchase of cannon,
torpedoes, and other instruments for murdering the
men with whom we wish to live in peace, and who
wish to live in peace with us; or, to receive a salary for
spending his life either in perfecting these instruments
of murder, or in the military exercises by which men
are trained for slaughter? Ask whether it be praiseworthy
or compatible with the dignity of man, or becoming
to a Christian, to undertake, also for money, to arrest
some unfortunate man, some illiterate drunkard, for
some petty theft not to be compared with the magnitude
of our own appropriation, or for manslaughter not conducted
by our advanced methods; and for such offenses
to throw people into prison, or put them to death?
Ask whether it be laudable and becoming in a man and a
Christian, also for money, to teach the people foolish and
injurious superstitions instead of the doctrine of Christ?
Whether, again, it be laudable and worthy of a man
to wrench from his neighbor, in order to gratify his
own caprice, the very necessaries of life, as the great
landowners do; or to exact from his fellow-man an
excessive and exhausting toil for the purpose of increasing
his own wealth, as the mill-owners and manufacturers
do; or to take advantage of human necessities
to build up colossal fortunes, as the merchants
do?</p>

<p>Every individual would reply not, especially if the
question regarded his neighbor. And at the same
time the very man who acknowledges all the ignominy of
such deeds, when the case is presented to him, will often,
of his own accord, and for no advantage of a salary, but
moved by childish vanity, the desire to possess a trinket
of enamel, a decoration, a stripe, voluntarily enter the
military service, or become an examining magistrate, a
justice of the peace, a minister of state, an <em>uriadnik</em>, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
bishop, accepting an office whose duties will oblige him
to do things, the shame and ignominy of which he cannot
help realizing.</p>

<p>Many of these men will, I am sure, defend themselves
on the ground of the lawfulness and necessity of their
position; they will argue that the authorities are of God,
that the functions of State are indispensable for the
good of mankind, that Christianity is not opposed to
wealth, that the rich youth was bidden to give up his
goods only if he wished to be perfect, that the present
distribution of wealth and commerce is beneficial to all
men, and that it is right and lawful. But however much
they may try to deceive themselves and others, they all
know that what they do is opposed to the highest interests
of life, and at the bottom of their hearts, when they
listen only to their consciences, they are ashamed and
pained to think of what they are doing, especially when
the baseness of their deeds has been pointed out to
them. A man in modern life, whether he does or does
not profess to believe in the divinity of Christ, must
know that to be instrumental either as a czar, minister,
governor, or policeman, as in selling a poor family's last
cow to pay taxes to the treasury, the money of which is
devoted to the purchase of cannon or to pay the salaries
or pensions of idle and luxurious officials, is to do more
harm than good; or to be a party to the imprisonment
of the father of a family, for whose demoralization we
are ourselves responsible, and to bring his family to
beggary; or to take part in piratical and murderous
warfare; or to teach absurd superstitions of idol-worship
instead of the doctrine of Christ; or to impound a stray
cow belonging to a man who has no land; or to deduct
the value of an accidentally injured article from the
wages of a mechanic; or to sell something to a poor
man for double its value, only because he is in dire
necessity;&mdash;the men of our modern life cannot but
know that all such deeds are wrong, shameful, and that
they ought not to commit them. They do all know it.
They know that they are doing wrong, and would
abstain from it, had they but the strength to oppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
those forces which blind them to the criminality of their
actions while drawing them on to do wrong.</p>

<p>But there is nothing that demonstrates so vividly the
degree of contradiction to which human life has attained
as the system that embodies both the method and the
expression of violence,&mdash;the general conscription system.
It is only because a general armament and military
conscription have come imperceptibly and by slow
degrees, and that governments employ for their support
all the means of intimidation at their disposal,&mdash;bribery,
bewilderment, and violence,&mdash;that we do not realize the
glaring contradiction between this state of affairs and
those Christian feelings and ideas with which all modern
men are penetrated.</p>

<p>This contradiction has become so common that we fail
to see the shocking imbecility and immorality of the
actions, not only of those men who, of their own accord,
choose the profession of murder as something honorable,
but of those unfortunates who consent to serve in the
army, and of those who, in countries where military
conscription has not yet been introduced, give of their
own free will the fruits of their labor to be used for
the payment of mercenaries and for the organization for
murder. All these men are either Christians or men
professing humanitarianism and liberalism, who know
that they participate in the most imbecile, aimless, and
cruel murders; yet still they go on committing them.
But this is not all. In Germany, where the system of
general military conscription originated, Caprivi has
revealed something that has always been carefully hidden:
that the men who run the risk of being killed are
not only foreigners, but are quite as likely to be fellow-countrymen,&mdash;working-men,&mdash;from
which class most of
the soldiers are obtained. Nevertheless, this admission
neither opened men's eyes nor shocked their sensibilities.
They continue just as they did before, to go like sheep,
and submit to anything that is demanded of them. And
this is not all. The German Emperor has recently explained
with minute precision the character and vocation
of a soldier, having distinguished, thanked, and rewarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
a private for killing a defenseless prisoner who attempted
to escape. In thanking and rewarding a man for an
act which is looked upon even by men of the lowest
type of morality as base and cowardly, Wilhelm pointed
out that the principal duty of a soldier, and one most
highly prized by the authorities, is that of an executioner,&mdash;not
like the professional executioners who put to death
condemned prisoners only, but an executioner of the innocent
men whom his superiors order him to kill.</p>

<p>Yet more. In 1891 this same Wilhelm, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enfant
terrible</i> of State authority, who expresses what other men
only venture to think, in a talk with certain soldiers,
uttered publicly the following words, which were repeated
the next day in thousands of papers:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Recruits! You have given <em>me</em> the oath of allegiance
before the altar and the servant of the Lord. You are
still too young to comprehend the true meaning of what
has been said here, but first of all take care ever to follow
the orders and instructions that are given to you.
You have taken the oath of allegiance to <em>me</em>; this means,
children of my guards, that you are now <em>my</em> soldiers, that
you have given yourselves up to me, body and soul.</p>

<p>"But one enemy exists for you&mdash;<em>my</em> enemy. With the
present socialistic intrigues <em>it may happen that I shall command
you to shoot your own relatives, your brothers, even
your parents</em> (from which may God preserve us!), <em>and then
you are in duty bound to obey my orders unhesitatingly</em>."</p>

<p>This man expresses what is known, but carefully concealed,
by all wise rulers. He says outright that the
men who serve in the army serve <em>him</em>and <em>his</em> advantage,
and should be ready for that purpose to kill their
brothers and fathers.</p>

<p>Roughly but distinctly he lays bare all the horror of
the crime for which men who become soldiers prepare
themselves,&mdash;all that abyss of self-abasement into which
they fling themselves when they promise obedience. Like
a bold hypnotizer, he tests the depth of the slumber; he
applies red-hot iron to the sleeper's body; it smokes and
shrivels, but the sleeper does not awaken.</p>

<p>Poor, sick, miserable man, intoxicated with power, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
by these words insults all that is sacred to men of modern
civilization! And we, Christians, liberals, men of
culture, so far from feeling indignant at this insult, pass
it over in silence. Men are put to the final test in its
rudest form; but they hardly observe that a test is in
question, that a choice is put before them. It seems to
them as if there were no choice, but only the one necessity
of slavish submission. It would seem as if these insane
words, offensive to all that a civilized human being holds
sacred, ought to rouse indignation,&mdash;but nothing of the
kind happens. Year after year every young man in
Europe is subjected to the same test, and with very
few exceptions they all forswear what is and should
be sacred to every man; all manifest a readiness to kill
their brothers and even their fathers, at the order of the
first misguided man who wears a red and gold livery,
asking only when and whom they are to be ordered to
kill&mdash;for they are ready to do it.</p>

<p>Even by savages certain objects are held sacred, for
whose sake they are ready to suffer rather than submit.
But what is sacred for the man of the modern world?
He is told: Be my slave, in a bondage where you may
have to murder your own father; and he, oftentimes a
man of learning, who has studied all the sciences in the
university, submissively offers his neck to the halter.
He is dressed in a clown's garments, ordered to leap, to
make contortions, to salute, to kill&mdash;and he submissively
obeys; and when at last allowed to return to his former
life, he continues to hold forth on the dignity of man,
freedom, equality, and brotherhood.</p>

<p>"But what is to be done?" we often hear men ask in
perplexity. "If every man were to refuse, it would be
a different matter; but, as it is, I should suffer alone
without benefiting any one." And they are right; for a
man who holds the social life-conception cannot refuse.
Life has no significance for him except as it concerns
his personal welfare; it is for his advantage to submit,
therefore he does so.</p>

<p>To whatever torture or injury he may be subjected he
will submit, because he can do nothing alone; he lacks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
the foundation which alone would enable him to resist
violence, and those who are in authority over him will
never give him the chance of uniting with others.</p>

<p>It has often been said that the invention of the terrible
military instruments of murder will put an end to war,
and that war will exhaust itself. This is not true. As
it is possible to increase the means for killing men, so it
is possible to increase the means for subjecting those who
hold the social life-conception. Let them be exterminated
by thousands and millions, let them be torn to pieces,
men will still continue like stupid cattle to go to the
slaughter, some because they are driven thither under
the lash, others that they may win the decorations and
ribbons which fill their hearts with pride.</p>

<p>And it is with material like this that the public leaders&mdash;conservatives,
liberals, socialists, anarchists&mdash;discuss
the ways and means of organizing an intelligent and
moral society, with men who have been so thoroughly
confused and bewildered that they will promise to murder
their own parents. What kind of intelligence and
morality can there be in a society organized from material
like this? Just as it is impossible to build a house from
bent and rotten timber, however manipulated, so also is
it impossible with such materials to organize an intelligent
and moral society. They can only be governed like
a drove of cattle, by the shouts and lash of the herdsman.
And so, indeed, they are governed.</p>

<p>Again, while on the one hand we find men, Christians
in name, professing the principles of liberty, equality,
and fraternity, on the other hand we see these same men
ready, in the name of liberty, to yield the most abject and
slavish obedience; in the name of equality, to approve
of the most rigid and senseless subdivision of men into
classes; and in the name of fraternity, ready to slay their
own brothers.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>
<p>The contradiction of the moral consciousness, and
hence the misery of life, has reached its utmost limit,
beyond which it can go no further. Life, based on
principles of violence, has culminated in the negation
of the basis on which it was founded. The organization,
on principles of violence, of a society whose object
was to insure the happiness of the individual and the
family, and the social welfare of humanity, has brought
men to such a pass that these benefits are practically
annulled.</p>

<p>The first part of the prophecy in regard to those men
and their descendants who adopted this doctrine has been
fulfilled, and now their descendants are forced to realize
the justice of its second part.</p>

<h3>THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE-CONCEPTION
DELIVERS MEN FROM THE MISERIES OF OUR PAGAN
LIFE</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The external life of Christian nations remains pagan, but they are already
penetrated by the Christian life-conception&mdash;The issue from this contradiction
is in the acceptance of the Christian life-conception&mdash;In it alone
is every man free, and it alone frees him from all human authority&mdash;This
deliverance is brought about, not by a change of external conditions, but
only by a change in the conception of one's life&mdash;The Christian life-conception
demands the renunciation of violence, and, in delivering the man
who accepts it, it frees the world from all external authority&mdash;The issue
from the present apparently hopeless position consists in every man accepting
the Christian life-conception and living accordingly&mdash;But men
consider this method too slow, and see their salvation in change of the
material conditions of life made with the aid of the authority of the
State&mdash;This method will have no issue, because men themselves cause
the evil from which they suffer&mdash;This is especially evident in regard to
the submissive acceptance of military duty, for it is more advantageous
for a man to refuse than accept&mdash;Human freedom will be brought about
only through the liberation of each individual man, and already there
are signs of this liberation, which threatens to destroy State organization&mdash;The
repudiation of the un-Christian demands of governments
undermines their authority and makes men free&mdash;Therefore instances
of such refusals are feared by governments more than conspiracies or
violence&mdash;Instances, in Russia, of refusals to take the oath of allegiance,
to pay taxes, to accept passports or positions in the police, to take part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
in courts of law, or to be drafted as soldiers&mdash;Similar instances in other
countries&mdash;Governments know not how to dispose of men who refuse
to obey their requirements because of the Christian doctrine&mdash;These
men destroy without a struggle the foundations of governments from
the inside&mdash;To punish them would mean for governments to deny
Christianity themselves, and to contribute to the diffusion of that consciousness
from which such refusals spring&mdash;Hence the position of
governments is a desperate one, and men who preach the uselessness of
personal deliverance only arrest the destruction of the existing system
of government founded on violence.</p></blockquote>


<p>The Christian nations of the present day are in a position
no less cruel than that of pagan times. In many
respects, especially in the matter of oppression, their
position has grown worse.</p>

<p>A contrast like that of modern and ancient times may
be seen in the vegetation of the last days of autumn as
compared with that of the early days of spring. In the
autumn the outward decay and death correspond to the
interior process, which is the suspension of life; in
the spring the apparent lifelessness is in direct contradiction
to the real vitality within, and the approaching
transition to new forms of life.</p>

<p>And thus it is as regards the apparent resemblance
between pagan life and that of the present day. It
exists only in appearance. The inner lives of men in the
times of paganism were quite unlike those of the men
of our days.</p>

<p>In the former the external aspect of cruelty and slavery
corresponded with the inner consciousness of men, a
conformity which only increased as time went on; in
the latter the external condition of cruelty and slavery
is in utter contradiction to the Christian consciousness
of men, a contradiction which grows more and more
striking every year.</p>

<p>The misery and suffering resulting therefrom seem
so useless. It is like prolonged suffering in child-labor.
Everything is ready for the coming life, and yet no life
appears.</p>

<p>Apparently the situation is without deliverance. It
would indeed be so were it not that to men, and therefore
to the world, there has been vouchsafed the capacity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
for a loftier conception of life, which has the power
to set free, and at once, from all fetters, however firmly
riveted.</p>

<p>And this is the Christian life-conception presented to
men 1800 years ago.</p>

<p>A man has but to assimilate this life-conception and
he will be set free, as a matter of course, from the fetters
that now restrain him, and feel free as a bird who
spreads his wings and flies over the wall that has kept
him a prisoner.</p>

<p>They talk of setting the Christian Church free from
the State, of granting freedom to or withholding it
from Christians. Such thoughts and expressions are
strangely misleading. Liberty can neither be granted
to nor withheld from a Christian or Christians.</p>

<p>But if there is a question of granting or withholding
liberty, then evidently it is not the true Christians who
are meant, but only men who call themselves by that
name. A Christian cannot help being free, because in
the pursuit and attainment of his object no one can
either hinder or retard him.</p>

<p>A man has but to understand his life as Christianity
teaches him to understand it; that is, he must realize
that it does not belong to himself, nor to his family, nor
to the State, but to Him who sent him into the world;
he must therefore know that it is his duty to live, not in
accordance with the law of his own personality, nor of
that of his family or State, but to fulfil the infinite law
of Him who gave him life, in order to feel himself so
entirely free from all human authority that he will cease
to regard it as a possible obstacle.</p>

<p>A man needs but to realize that the object of his life
is the fulfilment of God's law; then the preëminence of
that law, claiming as it does his entire allegiance, will of
necessity invalidate the authority and restrictions of all
human laws.</p>

<p>The Christian who contemplates that law of love implanted
in every human soul, and quickened by Christ,
the only guide for all mankind, is set free from human
authority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>A Christian may suffer from external violence, may be
deprived of his personal freedom, may be a slave to his
passions,&mdash;the man who commits sin is the slave of the
sin,&mdash;but he cannot be controlled or coerced by threats
into committing an act contrary to his consciousness.
He cannot be forced to this, because the privations and
sufferings that are so powerful an influence over men
who hold the social life-conception have no influence
whatever over him. The privations and sufferings that
destroy the material welfare which is the object of the
social life-conception produce no effect upon the welfare
of the Christian's life, which rests on the consciousness
that he is doing God's will&mdash;nay, they may even serve
to promote that welfare when they are visited upon him
for fulfilling that will.</p>

<p>A Christian, therefore, who submits to the inner, the
divine law, is not only unable to execute the biddings of
the outward law when they are at variance with his consciousness
of God's law of love, as in the case of the
demands made upon him by the government; but he
cannot acknowledge the obligation of obeying any individual
whomsoever, cannot acknowledge himself to be
what is called a subject. For a Christian to promise to
subject himself to any government whatsoever&mdash;a subjection
which may be considered the foundation of State
life&mdash;is a direct negation of Christianity; since an individual
who promises beforehand to obey implicitly
every law that men may enact, by that promise utters
an emphatic denial of Christianity, whose very essence
is obedience in all contingencies to the law which he
feels to be within him&mdash;the law of love.</p>

<p>With the pagan life-conception it was possible to
promise to obey the will of temporal authorities without
violating the laws of God, which were supposed to
consist in carrying out such customs as circumcision,
the observance of the Sabbath, the utterance of prayer
at certain periods, abstinence from certain kinds of
food, etc. The one did not contradict the other. But
Christianity differs from paganism inasmuch as its requirements
are not of an external or negative character;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
on the contrary, they are such as reverse man's
former relations toward his fellow-men, and may call
for acts on his part which could not be anticipated,
and consequently are not defined. Hence it is that a
Christian can neither promise to obey nor to disobey
the will of another, ignorant as he must be of the
nature of its requirements; not only must he refuse to
obey human laws, but he cannot promise to do or
abstain from doing anything definite at any given
time, because he can never tell at what hour or in
what manner the Christian law of love, on which his
life-conception is based, will demand his coöperation.
A Christian, promising in advance to obey unconditionally
the laws of men, admits by that promise that
the inner law of God does not constitute for him the
sole law of his life.</p>

<p>When a Christian promises to obey the commands
or laws of men, he is like a craftsman who, having
hired himself out to one master, promises at the same
time to execute the orders of other persons. No man
can serve two masters.</p>

<p>A Christian is freed from human authority by acknowledging
the supremacy of one authority alone, that
of God, whose law, revealed to him through Christ, he
recognizes within himself, and obeys,&mdash;that and no
other.</p>

<p>And this deliverance is accomplished neither by
means of a struggle, nor by the destruction of previous
customs of life, but only through a change in his life-conception.
The deliverance proceeds, in the first
place, from the Christian's acknowledgment of the law
of love, as revealed to him by his Teacher, which suffices
to determine the relations of men, and according
to which every act of violence seems superfluous and
unlawful. Secondly, because those privations and miseries,
or the anticipations of such, which influence a
man who holds the social life-conception and reduces
him to obedience, seem to him no more than the inevitable
consequences of existence, which he would never
dream of opposing by violence, but bears patiently, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
he would bear disease, hunger, or any other misery;
which, indeed, have no possible influence over his actions.
The Christian's only guide must be the divine
indwelling element, subject neither to restriction nor to
control.</p>

<p>A Christian lives in accordance with the words
spoken by the Master: "He shall not strive, nor cry;
neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets. A
bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall
he not quench, <em>till he send forth judgment unto victory</em>."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>A Christian enters into no dispute with his neighbor,
he neither attacks nor uses violence; on the contrary,
he suffers violence himself without resistance, and by
his very attitude toward evil not only sets himself free,
but helps to free the world at large from all outward
authority.</p>

<p>"And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall
make you free."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> If there were any doubt of the truth
of Christianity there could be no more indubitable proof
of its authenticity than the complete freedom, recognizing
no fetters, which a man feels as soon as he assimilates
the Christian life-conception.</p>

<p>Human beings in their present condition may be
likened to bees in the act of swarming, as we see them
clinging in a mass to a single bough. Their position is
a temporary one, and must inevitably be changed.
They must rise and find themselves a new abode.
Every bee knows this, and is eager to shift its own
position, as well as that of the others, but not one of
them will do so until the whole swarm rises. The swarm
cannot rise, because one bee clings to the other and prevents
it from separating itself from the swarm, and so
they all continue to hang. It might seem as if there
were no deliverance from this position, precisely as it
seems to men of the world who have become entangled
in the social net. Indeed, there would be no outlet for
the bees if each one were not a living creature possessed
of a pair of wings. Neither would there be any issue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
for men if each one were not a living individual, being
gifted with a capacity for assimilating the Christian
life-conception.</p>

<p>If among these bees who are able to fly not one could
be found willing to start, the swarm would never change
its position. And it is the same among men. If the
man who has assimilated the Christian life-conception
waits for others before he proceeds to live in accordance
with it, mankind will never change its attitude. And
as all that is needed to change a solid mass of bees into
a flying swarm is for one bee to spread its wings and fly
away, when the second, the third, the tenth, and the
hundredth will follow suit; so all that is needed to break
through the magic circle of social life, deliverance from
which seems so hopeless, is, that one man should view
life from a Christian standpoint and begin to frame his
own life accordingly, whereupon others will follow in his
footsteps.</p>

<p>But men think that the deliverance of mankind by
this method is too slow a process, and that a simultaneous
deliverance might be effected by some other method.
Just as if bees, when the swarm was ready to rise, were
to decide that it would be too long a process if they
waited for each bee to spread its wings and rise separately,
and that some means must be devised whereby
the swarm may rise all at once, whenever it pleases.
But that is impossible. Not until the first, second, third,
and hundredth bee has unfolded its wings and flown
away can the swarm take flight and find for itself a new
home. Not until each individual man adopts the Christian
life-conception, and begins to live in conformity with
its precepts, will the contradictions of human life be
solved, and new forms of life become established.</p>

<p>One of the most striking events of our time is the
propaganda of slavery which is spread among the
masses, not only by the government, to whom it is of
use, but by those exponents of socialistic theories who
consider themselves the champions of freedom.</p>

<p>These men preach that the amelioration in the conditions
of life, the reconciliation between actuality and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
consciousness, will not be brought about by the personal
efforts of individual men, but that it will evolve itself
out of a certain forced reorganization of society by some
unknown influence. Their theory is that men should
not proceed of their own accord to the place where they
wish to go, but that they should have a platform built
under their feet, upon which they may be carried to the
spot they desire to reach. Hence they must not move
as far as their strength will permit, but all their efforts
must be directed toward building this imaginary platform
without stirring from their position.</p>

<p>There is a theory in economics preached in these days
of which the essential principle is this: the worse the
condition of affairs, the better the prospect; the greater
the accumulation of capital and oppression of the working-man
resulting therefrom, the nearer the day of
deliverance; and therefore any effort on the part of the
individual to free himself from the oppression of capital
is useless. In regard to the government it is declared
that the greater its authority, which, according to this
theory, should include the domain of private life, hitherto
uninvaded, the better it will be, and hence one should
solicit the interference of governments with private life.
In regard to international politics, it is declared that the
increase of armies and modes of extermination will lead
to the necessity of a general disarmament through the
agency of congresses, arbitration, etc. And the most
surprising part of all is that human lethargy is so profound
that men credit these theories, although the whole
structure of life, and every stage in human progress,
demonstrate their fallacy.</p>

<p>Men suffer from oppression, and by way of deliverance
certain expedients are suggested for the improvement
of their condition, these means of relief to be
administered by authority, to which they continue to submit.
This will naturally tend to augment authority and
to increase the consequent oppression of government.</p>

<p>Of all the errors of humanity there is none that so
retards its progress as this. Men will do anything in
the world to achieve their purpose save the one simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
deed, which it is every man's duty to perform. Men
will invent the most ingenious devices for changing the
position which is burdensome to them, but never dream
of the simple remedy of abstaining from the acts which
cause it.</p>

<p>I was told of an incident which happened to an intrepid
<i lang="cs" xml:lang="cs">stanovoy</i>, who, on arriving in a village where the
peasants had revolted, and whither troops had been
sent, undertook, like the Emperor Nicholas I., to quell
the disturbance by his personal influence. He ordered
several loads of rods to be brought, and having gathered
all the peasants into the barn, he entered himself, shut
himself in with them, and so terrified them by his shouts
and threats that in compliance with his commands they
began to flog each other. And so they went on flogging
one another until some fool revolted, and, shouting
to his comrades, bade them leave off. It was not until
then that the flogging ceased, and the <i lang="cs" xml:lang="cs">stanovoy</i> escaped
from the barn.</p>

<p>It is this very advice of the fool that men who believe
in the necessity of civil government seem unable to follow.
They are unable to stop punishing themselves, and
setting an absurd example for others to imitate. Such is
the consummation of merely human wisdom.</p>

<p>Is it possible, indeed, to imagine a more striking imitation
of those men flogging one another than the meekness
with which the men of these days fulfil those social
duties that lead them into bondage, especially the
military conscription? It is clear that men enslave
themselves; they suffer from this slavery, and yet they
believe it inevitable; they also believe that it will not
affect the ultimate emancipation of mankind, which they
declare the final outcome, in spite of the fact that
slavery is ever increasing.</p>

<p>The man of modern times, whoever he may be (I do
not mean a true Christian), educated or ignorant, a
believer or an unbeliever, rich or poor, married or single,
does his work, takes his pleasures, and dreads all
restrictions and privations, all enmity and suffering.
Thus he is living, peaceably. Suddenly men come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
him and say: "First, promise on your oath that you
will obey us like a slave in all that we command; believe
that whatever we tell you is unquestionably true,
and submit to all that we shall call laws. Or, secondly,
give us a share in the product of your labor, that we
may use it to keep you in bondage, and prevent you
from revolting against our commands. Or, thirdly,
choose, or be chosen among, the so-called officials of the
government, knowing that the government will go on
quite regardless of the foolish speeches which you, or
others like you, may utter; that it will be carried on in
accordance with our wishes and the wishes of those who
control the army. Or, fourthly, come to the law-courts,
and take part in all the senseless cruelties which we commit
against men, who are erring and depraved men, and
who have become so through our fault,&mdash;in the form of
imprisonment, exile, solitary confinement, and execution.
Or, lastly, although you may be on the most friendly
terms with men who belong to other nations, you must
be ready at a moment's notice, whenever the command
is issued, to look upon such of them as we shall indicate
as your enemies, and either personally or by substitute
contribute to the ruin, robbery, and murder of these
men, of old men, women, and children&mdash;even, if we
require it, of your fellow-countrymen and your parents."</p>

<p>One would think that in these days there could be
but one reply from any man in his senses.</p>

<p>"Why must I do all this? Why must I promise to
obey all the orders of Salisbury to-day, those of Gladstone
to-morrow; Boulanger to-day, and to-morrow the
orders of an assembly composed of men like Boulanger;
Peter III. to-day, Catharine to-morrow, and the next day
Pugatchov; to-day the insane King of Bavaria, to-morrow
the Emperor William? Why should I promise this to
men whom I know to be wicked or foolish, or men
whom I know nothing at all about? Why should
I, in the form of taxes, hand over to them the fruits of
my labor, knowing that this money will be used to
bribe officials, to support prisons, churches, and armies,
to pay for the execution of evil acts destined for my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
oppression? In other words, why should I apply the
rod to my own back? Why should I go on wasting
my time, averting my eyes, helping to give a semblance
of legality to the acts of wrong-doers, play a part in
elections, and pretend to participate in the government,
when I know perfectly well that the country is ruled by
those who control the army? Why should I go into
the courts and be a party to the infliction of tortures
and executions upon my erring fellow-beings, knowing,
if I am a Christian, that the law of love has been substituted
for the law of vengeance, and if I am an educated
man, that punishment, so far from reforming its
victims, serves only to demoralize them? Why should
I, in person or in substitute, go and kill and despoil,
and expose myself to the dangers of war, simply because
the key of the temple of Jerusalem happens to be in
the keeping of one bishop rather than in that of another;
because Bulgaria is to be ruled by one German prince
instead of another; or because the privileges of the seal
fishery are reserved for the English to the exclusion of
the American merchants. Why should I regard as my
enemies the inhabitants of a neighboring country, with
whom up to the present day I have lived, and still wish to
live, in peace and amity,&mdash;why should I go myself, or
pay for soldiers, to murder and ruin them?</p>

<p>"And, above all, why should I contribute, whether in
person or by paying for military service, to the enslavement
and destruction of my brothers and parents? Why
should I scourge myself? All this is of no use to me;
on the contrary, it does me harm. It is altogether
degrading, immoral, mean, and contemptible. Why,
then, should I do all this? If I am told that I shall
be made to suffer in any event, I reply that in the first
place, there can be no possible suffering greater than
that which would befall me were I to execute your
commands. And in the second place, it is perfectly
evident to me that if we refuse to scourge ourselves, no
one else will do it for us. Governments are but sovereigns,
statesmen, officials, who can no more force me
against my will, than the <i lang="cs" xml:lang="cs">stanovoy</i> could force the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
peasants; I should be brought before the court, or
thrown into prison, or executed, not by the sovereign,
or the high officials, but by men in the same position
as myself; and as it would be equally injurious and
disagreeable for them to be scourged as for me, I should
probably open their eyes, and they would not only refrain
from injuring me, but would doubtless follow my
example. And in the third place, though I were made
to suffer for this, it would still be better for me to be exiled
or imprisoned, doing battle in the cause of common
sense and truth, which must eventually triumph, if not
to-day, then to-morrow, or before many days, than to
suffer in the cause of folly and evil. It would rather
be to my advantage to risk being exiled, imprisoned, or
even executed, than remain, through my own fault, a
life-long slave of evil men, to be ruined by an invading
enemy, or mutilated like an idiot, or killed while defending
a cannon, a useless territory, or a senseless piece of
cloth called a flag. I have no inclination to scourge
myself, it would be of no use. You may do it yourselves
if you choose&mdash;I refuse."</p>

<p>It would seem as though not only the religious and
moral element in human nature, but ordinary common
sense and wise counsel, would influence every man of
the present day thus to make reply, and to suit the
action to the word. But no. Men who hold the social
life-conception consider such a course not only useless,
but even prejudicial to the object in view,&mdash;the deliverance
of mankind from slavery. They advise us to go
on, like the peasants, punishing one another, comforting
ourselves with the reflection that our chatter in parliaments
and assemblies, our trade unions, our First of
May demonstrations, our conspiracies and covert threats
to the governments that scourge us, must result in our
final deliverance, even though we go on strengthening
our fetters. Nothing so hampers human liberty as this
wonderful delusion. Instead of making individual
efforts to achieve freedom, every man for himself devoting
all his energies to that object, through the attainment
of a new life-conception, men are looking for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
universal scheme of deliverance, and are in the meanwhile
sinking deeper and deeper into slavery. It is as
if a man were to declare that in order to obtain heat
one must merely place every lump of coal in a certain
position, never minding whether it kindled or not. And
yet that the liberation of mankind can only be accomplished
by means of the deliverance of the individual
grows more and more evident.</p>

<p>The liberation of individuals from the dominion of
the State, in the name of the Christian life-conception,
which was formerly an exceptional occurrence and one
that attracted but little attention, has attained in these
days a menacing significance for the authority of State.</p>

<p>If in the days of ancient Rome it happened that a
Christian, professing his faith, refused to take a part in
sacrifices, or in the worship of the emperors or the gods,
or in the Middle Ages refused to worship ikons or to
acknowledge the temporal authority of the Pope, such
refusals were the exception; a man might be obliged to
confess to his faith, but he might perhaps live all his
life without being forced to do so. But now all men,
without exception, are subjected to trial of faith. Every
man of modern times is obliged, either to participate in
the cruelties of pagan life, or to repudiate them. And
secondly, in those days any refusal to bow before the
gods, the ikons, or the Pope was of no consequence to
the State. Whether those who bowed before the gods,
the ikons, or the Pope were many or few, the State lost
none of its power. Whereas at the present time every
refusal to execute the un-Christian demands of the
government undermines the authority of the State,
because the authority of the State rests on the fulfilment
of these anti-Christian requirements.</p>

<p>Temporal authority, in order to maintain itself, has
been forced by the conditions of life to demand from
its subjects certain actions which it is impossible for men
who profess true Christianity to perform. Therefore at
the present time every man who professes it helps to undermine
the authority of the government, and will eventually
pave the way for the liberation of mankind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>Of what apparent importance are such acts as the
refusal of a score or two of fools, as they are called,&mdash;men
who decline to take the oath of allegiance, to pay
taxes, or to take part in courts of law, or to serve in the
army? Such men are tried and condemned, and life
remains unchanged. These occurrences may seem unimportant,
and yet these are precisely the factors that
undermine the authority of the government more than
any others, and thus prepare the way for the liberation
of mankind. These are the bees who are the first to
separate themselves from the swarm, and, still hovering
near, they wait for the whole swarm to rise and follow
them. The governments are aware of this, and look
upon such occurrences with more apprehension than
upon all the socialists, anarchists, and communists, with
their conspiracies and their dynamite bombs.</p>

<p>A new <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i> is inaugurated. Each subject, according
to custom, is required to take the oath of allegiance
to the new government. A proclamation is issued, and
all are bidden to assemble in the cathedral to take the
oath. Suddenly one man in Perm, another in Tula, a
third in Moscow, a fourth in Kaluga, refuse to take
the oath and (without preconcerted action) justify their
refusal by the same argument,&mdash;that the Christian law
forbids the oath; but, even were the oath not forbidden,
they could not, according to the spirit of this law, promise
to perform such evil deeds as the oath requires,&mdash;such
as reporting those antagonistic to the interests of
the government, defending that government by armed
force, or attacking its enemies. They are summoned to
appear before the <i lang="cs" xml:lang="cs">Stanovoys</i>, <i lang="cs" xml:lang="cs">spravniks</i>, priests, governors;
they are reasoned with, coaxed, threatened, and
punished; yet they adhere to their determination, and
refuse to take the oath. They are asked, "Is it true
that you never took the oath?"</p>

<p>"It is."</p>

<p>"And what was done to you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>Every subject is required to pay his taxes, and the
taxes are paid. But one man in Charkov, another in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Iver, and a third in Samara, refuse to comply, and, as
by one accord, each man alleges the same reason. One
of them says that he will pay after he has learned the
object for which his money is to be used. "If it is to
be used for charity, he will give of his own free will,
and even more than is demanded of him. But if it is
to be applied to evil purposes, he will give nothing of
his own free will, because, according to the law of
Christ, which he obeys, he can take no part in doing
evil." And the others who refuse to pay taxes, except
on compulsion, express the same idea, perhaps in other
words. Those who have property are forced to pay,
and those who have none are simply let alone.</p>

<p>"Then you have not paid your tax?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"And what was done to you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>The passport system is instituted. Every man who
leaves his home must apply for one, and pay a tax for
it. Suddenly, in different places, are to be found those
who declare that passports should not be used, that a
man should not acknowledge his dependence upon the
State, which is supported by violence; and these men
take no passports, consequently they pay no tax for
them. And again, there are no means of coercing them
to comply with the demand. They are imprisoned, but
when after a time they find themselves at liberty again,
they go on living without passports.</p>

<p>Every peasant is expected to perform police duty as
<em>sotsky</em> or <em>dessiatsky</em>,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> etc.; but some peasant in Charkov
refuses to fulfil this duty, because, as he says in explanation
of his refusal, the law of Christ, which he professes,
forbids him to arrest, imprison, or transport his fellow-men.
Another peasant in Iver or in Tambov makes the
same statement. The peasants are threatened, beaten,
and imprisoned, but they adhere to their resolution, and
refuse to perform actions contrary to their religious
belief. And they cease to be elected <em>sotsky</em>, and are
gradually left in peace.</p>

<p>It is the duty of every citizen to serve on the jury.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
All at once men of widely different classes,&mdash;carriage-makers,
professors, merchants, peasants, nobles,&mdash;as if
moved by a single impulse, refuse to fulfil this duty, not
for reasons valid in the eyes of the law, but because the
tribunal itself is, in their opinion, illegal and un-Christian,
and ought not to exist. These men are fined, and false
reasons are ascribed for their refusal, the true ones meanwhile
remaining hidden from the public. The same
treatment is employed in regard to those who, for similar
reasons, refuse to appear as witnesses in courts of law.
These, too, are finally left undisturbed.</p>

<p>Every man at the age of twenty-one must draw lots.
Suddenly there is found a man in Moscow, another in
Iver, another in Charkov, and still another in Kiev, who,
as it were by agreement, go to the department and declare
that they will neither take the oath of allegiance
nor serve in the army, because they are Christians.
Here are the details of an affair which was among the
earlier cases,&mdash;of late these refusals have begun to multiply,&mdash;a
case with which I am myself familiar,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> which
is but one example among many.</p>

<p>In the City Hall of Moscow a young man of average
education gives his reasons for refusing to comply. His
words are not heeded, and he is bidden to repeat the
words of the oath with the other men. He still persists
in his refusal, and quotes a certain passage in the Bible
that forbids men to take an oath. No attention is paid
to his arguments, and again he is ordered to take the
oath, which he declines to do. Whereupon it is taken
for granted that he is a sectarian, and therefore misunderstands
Christianity; in other words, that he differs
from the priests paid by the State. He is then sent under
guard to the priests that they may convince him,
which they endeavor to do; but the arguments uttered
in the name of Christ, by which they strive to persuade
him to deny Christ, evidently have no effect on the young
man. So they declare him incorrigible, and send him
back to the army. Still he openly refuses to take the
oath and to fulfil his military duties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a case not anticipated by the law. A refusal to
comply with the demands of the government cannot be
overlooked, neither can this case be called one of ordinary
insubordination. After conferring, the military
authorities decide that, in order to rid themselves of this
objectionable youth, the better way will be to consider
him as a rebel and forward him under military escort to
the Department of the Secret Police. The police officials
and the gendarmes question the young man, but
his replies will not serve to classify his offense under the
heading of any crime that comes within their jurisdiction;
they cannot either accuse him of revolutionary motives,
or of conspiracy, because he declares that he has no desire
to destroy anything whatsoever; on the contrary, he
opposes all violence. He says that he has nothing to
conceal; he desires only an opportunity for saying and
doing all things in the most open manner. And as it
resulted with the clergy, so also with the gendarmes, who,
though rarely embarrassed as to how to put the law in
operation, can find no pretext for an accusation against
the young man, and send him back to the ranks. Once
more there is a conference, and his superiors decide that,
although he has not taken the oath of allegiance, he is
to be regarded as a soldier. He is put into uniform, his
name is entered on the lists, and he is sent under convoy
to his post. Here his immediate superiors once more
order him to perform his military duty, and still he refuses
to obey, and in the presence of the other soldiers
he states his reasons, saying that, as a Christian, he
cannot of his own free will prepare himself to commit
murder, which was forbidden even by the law of Moses.</p>

<p>All this takes place in a provincial city. The occurrence
excites the interest and the sympathy, not
only of outsiders, but even of the officers, and therefore
there is hesitation about employing the usual punishment
for contumacy. However, for the sake of appearances,
he is thrown into jail, and a request is sent
to the higher military authorities for further instructions
in the case. From an official standpoint this refusal
to take part in a military organization, in which the Czar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
himself serves, and which is blessed by the Church,
must be regarded as insanity, and therefore the message
is received from St. Petersburg that the young
man is probably insane, and that before any violent
measures are used against him he must be sent to the
insane hospital. Thither he is sent in the hope that
he will remain there, as happened some ten years ago
in the case of a young man from Iver, who also refused
to serve, and who was tortured in the hospital until at
last he was subdued. But in the present instance even
this measure fails to relieve the military authorities
from this troublesome young man. The doctors examine
him, become interested in him, and, discovering
no symptoms of insanity, they return him to his post.
He is received, and pretending that his refusal and its
causes are forgotten, he is once more invited to join
the drill, and again he refuses, in the presence of other
soldiers, stating his reasons for his refusal. The affair
attracts more and more notice from soldiers as well as
from civilians. Again the question is referred to St.
Petersburg, and thence comes the order to transfer the
young man to the frontier, where the troops are in
active service, and where, if he refuses to obey orders,
he may be shot without exciting attention, as there are
but few Russians and Christians in that far-away territory,
the majority being foreigners and Mohammedans.
This is done. The young man is ordered to join the
Trans-Caspian troops, and with other criminals he is
delivered into the hands of commanders noted for their
severity and determination.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, during all these transportations from
place to place, the young man has suffered from harsh
treatment, from cold, hunger, and filth, and his life
has been made miserable. Yet all these trials do not
weaken his resolution. In the Trans-Caspian province,
where he is once more ordered to serve as a sentry
under arms, he refuses to obey. He consents to stand
where he is sent, beside the hayricks, but declines to
take a weapon in his hand, declaring that on no account
will he use violence against any one whomsoever.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
All this occurs in the presence of the soldiers.
Such contumacy cannot go unpunished; consequently
he is court-martialed for an infringement of military
discipline, convicted, and sentenced to two years' confinement
in a military prison. And once again, with
the criminals, he is sent by <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">étape</i> to the Caucasus and
then thrown into prison, his fate being left to the discretionary
power of the jailer. There he is tortured
for a year and a half, but still his resolution to avoid
the use of weapons remains unchanged, and he continues
to explain to every one whom he meets the
reasons for his refusal. Toward the end of the second
year, before his term has really expired, he is set at
liberty; and although not in accordance with the law,
they are so anxious to rid themselves of him, that his
imprisonment is accepted as an equivalent of further
active service.</p>

<p>And in various parts of Russia others are found who,
as if by a concerted plan, imitate his example, and in
every case the action of the government is undecided,
vacillating, and underhanded. Some of these men are
confined in the insane hospitals, some are appointed
military clerks and sent to serve in Siberia, some are
made foresters, others are thrown into prison, others are
fined. At the present time several of these men are imprisoned,
not for their substantial offense, denying the
legality of the acts of the government, but for disobeying
the particular orders of their superiors. For instance,
an officer of the reserve recently failed to give information
of the place of his residence, and declined to serve
further in the army; he was fined thirty roubles for
disobeying the orders of the authorities,&mdash;and this he
declined to pay, except under compulsion. Several
peasants and soldiers who refused to take part in a
drill and to use weapons were put under arrest for disobedience
and contention.</p>

<p>Such instances of a refusal to comply with the demands
of the State when opposed to Christianity, especially
refusals to perform military service, occur not
only in Russia, but everywhere. I know that in Servia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
men from the so-called sect of Nazarenes steadily refuse
to enter the army, and the Austrian government has for
several years made futile attempts to convert them by
means of imprisonment. In 1885 there were 130 refusals
of this kind. I know that in Switzerland, in
1890, there were men in confinement in the castle
of Chillon for refusing to perform military duty whose
determination was not to be influenced by punishment.
Such refusals have occurred in Sweden; the men there
also were imprisoned, and the government carefully
concealed the affairs from the people. Similar instances
occurred in Prussia. I know of one subaltern officer in
the guards who, in 1891, in Berlin, announced to his
superiors that he, as a Christian, could not continue his
military service, and in spite of all remonstrances and
threats he adhered to his resolution. In the south
of France a community of men called the Hinschist has
recently been established (my information is derived
from the <cite>Peace Herald</cite> of July, 1891), who, as professing
the Christian doctrine, refuse to perform military duty.
At first they were told off to serve in hospitals, but
now, with the increase of the sect, they are punished
for insubordination, while they still refuse to bear arms.</p>

<p>Socialists, communists, and anarchists, with their
bombs and their revolutions, are far less dangerous to
governments than these men, who from different places
proclaim their refusals, all based upon the same doctrine,
familiar to all. Every government knows how to defend
itself from revolutionists; it holds the means in its
own hands, and therefore does not fear these external
foes. But what can a government do to protect itself
from men who declaim against all authority as useless,
superfluous, and injurious, offering, however, no opposition
to authority, merely rejecting its offices, dispensing
with its services, and therefore refusing to participate
in it?</p>

<p>The revolutionists say: "State organization is bad,
either for one reason or for another; it should be destroyed,
and replaced by such and such a system." But
a Christian says: "I know nothing of State organization,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
whether it be good or bad, and it is for this very
reason that I do not wish to support it. And I cannot
undertake submission, because such submission is contrary
to my conscience."</p>

<p>All the institutions of the State are opposed to the
conscience of a Christian: the oath of allegiance, taxation,
courts of law, armies; while the whole authority
of government is dependent upon them. Revolutionary
foes struggle against the government, but Christianity
enters not into this contest; internally, it destroys the
principles on which government is based.</p>

<p>With the Russian people, in whose midst, particularly
since the time of Peter I., the protest of Christianity
against the State has never ceased; in the midst of this
people, where the conditions of life are such that
whole communes emigrate to Turkey, China, and uninhabited
portions of the globe, who, so far from needing
the government, always consider it an unnecessary burden,
and only endure it as a calamity, whether it be
Russian, Chinese, or Turkish,&mdash;the cases of isolated
individuals who, from Christian motives, have liberated
themselves from the control of government have grown
more and more frequent in these latter days. Such
manifestations are particularly dreaded by the government
at the present time, because the men who protest
often belong not to the so-called lower, the uneducated
classes, but are men of average and even superior education,
and because these men explain their refusals,
not by some mystical belief peculiar to the individual, as
in olden times, nor do they complicate them with superstition
and fanaticism, like the sects of the Self-burners
or Bieguni, but assign as the reason for their refusals
the simplest, most obvious of truths, patent to and
admitted by all the world.</p>

<p>Thus men refuse to pay taxes of their own free will,
because the money is used to promote violence; in
other words, to pay the wages of the violators in the
army, for building prisons and fortresses, or for manufacturing
cannon,&mdash;in all of which, as Christians, they
consider it wrong and immoral to take a part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>They refuse to take the oath of allegiance, for were
they to promise to obey the authorities,&mdash;that is, men
who use violence,&mdash;they must contradict the sense of
the Christian doctrine.</p>

<p>They refuse to swear in court, because an oath is
distinctly forbidden by the gospel.</p>

<p>They decline police duties, because in that office they
would be compelled to use violence against their brethren
and to distress them, and a Christian cannot do
this.</p>

<p>They refuse to take part in courts of law, because
they look upon every tribunal as a vehicle for the law of
vengeance, and therefore incompatible with the Christian
law of forgiveness and love.</p>

<p>They decline to have anything to do with military
preparations, or to enter the ranks of the army, because
they neither can nor will be executioners, nor prepare
themselves for such an office.</p>

<p>And the reasons alleged for these refusals are of such
a nature that, however arbitrary the governments may
be, they cannot punish openly those who refuse.</p>

<p>Were the governments to punish men for such refusals,
they would be forced to abjure forever both
justice and virtue, those principles by which, as they
assure us, all their authority is supported.</p>

<p>What are governments to do with these men? Of
course they have the power to execute, to imprison, and
to condemn to transportation and penal servitude all
enemies who attempt to overthrow them by violence;
they can obtain by bribery half the men they need, and
have at their command millions of armed soldiers, who
are ready to put to death all the enemies of authority.
But what can be done with men who wish neither to
destroy nor to establish anything, whose sole desire
is to avoid in their own private lives any act that may
be opposed to the Christian law, and who consequently
refuse to perform duties which are regarded by the
government as the most natural and obligatory of
all?</p>

<p>If they were revolutionists, preaching violence and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
practising it, it would be an easy matter to oppose
them. Some might be bribed, some deceived, others
intimidated, and those who could neither be bought,
deceived, nor intimidated would be manifestly criminals,
enemies of society who, as such, could be executed or
beaten to death; and the people would approve the acts
of the government. If they were fanatics belonging to
some particular sect, one might, in view of the superstitions
inherent in their doctrine, refute at the same
time what truth their arguments contained. But what
is to be done with men who neither preach rebellion nor
any special dogmas, who wish to live in peace with all
mankind, who refuse to take the oath of allegiance or to
pay taxes, or to take part in tribunals, to perform military
service, and the various duties of a similar nature, on
which the whole organization of the State is founded?
What is to be done with them? They cannot be bribed.
The very risk they are willing to take shows their integrity.
Neither can they be deceived when these things
are represented as the commands of God, because their
refusal is based on the indubitable law of God, by which
the very men who are trying to coerce them to disobey
this law profess to hold themselves bound. It is vain to
hope to intimidate them by threats, because the very
suffering and privations which they endure for righteousness'
sake serve but to strengthen their devotion to their
faith, whose law distinctly commands them first of all to
obey God, to fear not them that kill the body, but
to fear those who can kill both body and soul. Neither
can they be executed or imprisoned for life. Their past
lives, their thoughts and actions, their friends, speak for
them; every one knows them to be gentle, kindly, and
harmless men, and it is impossible to represent them in
the light of criminals whose suppression is needed for
the salvation of society. Moreover, the execution of
men acknowledged by all to be virtuous would arouse
defenders who would endeavor to explain the causes
for their disobedience. And when all men are made
to recognize the reasons why these Christians refuse to
obey the demands of the State, they cannot fail to acknowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
the same obligation, and to admit that all
men should long since have refused obedience.</p>

<p>Confronted with these insubordinations, governments
find themselves in a desperate plight. They realize that
the prophecies of Christianity are about to be fulfilled,
that it is loosening the fetters of them that are in bonds
and setting men free; they realize that such freedom
will inevitably destroy those who have held mankind in
bondage. Governments realize this; they know that
their hours are counted, that they are helpless to resist.
All that they are able to do is to retard the hour of dissolution.
And this they try to do; but their position is
still a desperate one.</p>

<p>It is like the predicament of a conqueror who wishes
to preserve the town set on fire by the inhabitants. No
sooner does he put the fire out in one place than two
other fires break out; when he separates the burning
portion from the main body of a large building the
flames burst out at both extremities. These outbreaks
are not, as yet, of frequent occurrence, but the spark
has been kindled, and the fire will burn steadily until all
is consumed.</p>

<p>The position of governments in the presence of men
who profess Christianity is so precarious that very little
is needed to shake to pieces their power, built up through
so many centuries, and apparently so solid in structure.
And it is now that the sociologist comes forward, preaching
that it is useless, and even hurtful and immoral, for
the individual to emancipate himself alone.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that men have been working for a long
time to divert the course of a river; they have at last
succeeded in digging a canal, and all that remains now
is to make an opening and let the water flow through it
into the canal; suppose now certain other men arrive
upon the scene and suggest that, instead of letting the
water flow into the canal, it would be much better to
erect over the river some form of machinery, by means
of which the water would be poured from one side to
the other.</p>

<p>But things have gone too far. Governments are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
aware of their weakness and helplessness, and men of
the Christian faith are awakening from their torpor,
beginning already to realize their power.</p>

<p>"I am come to send fire on the earth," said Christ.</p>

<p>And this is the fire that begins to burn.</p>

in the organization of the State&mdash;Realization of the uselessness and immorality

the State, as a form of social life indispensable for the defense of the
good from the wicked, until all nations, and all members of each nation,
shall have become Christians&mdash;The more wicked are always those in

over the good&mdash;The acknowledgment by authority of the necessity of
struggle with evil by violence is equivalent to self-destruction&mdash;The
annihilation of violence is not only possible, but is going on before our
eyes&mdash;However, it is not destroyed by State violence, but through those
men who, obtaining power by violence, and recognizing its vanity and
futility, benefit by experience and become incapable of using violence&mdash;This
is the process through which individual men, as well as whole
nations, have passed&mdash;It is in that way that Christianity penetrates into
the consciousness of men, and not only is this accomplished despite the
violence used by authority, but through its agency, and therefore the
abolition of authority is not only without danger, but it goes on continually
as life itself&mdash;Objection of the defenders of the State system that
the diffusion of Christianity is improbable&mdash;Diffusion of Christian truth
interdicting violence accomplished not only slowly and gradually, by
the internal method, by individual recognition of the truth, by prophetic
intuition, by the realizing of the emptiness of power and abandonment
of it by individual men, but accomplished also by the external method,
by which large numbers of men, inferior in intellectual development, at
once, in view of their confidence in the others, adopt the new truth&mdash;The
diffusion of truth at a certain stage creates a public opinion, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
compels the majority of men who have previously opposed it to recognize
the new truth at once&mdash;Therefore a universal renunciation of violence
may very soon come to pass; namely, when a Christian public opinion
shall be established&mdash;The conviction of the necessity of violence prevents
the establishment of Christian public opinion&mdash;Violence compels
men to discredit the moral force which can alone exalt them&mdash;Neither
nations nor individual men have been conquered by violence, but by
public opinion, which no violence can resist&mdash;It is possible to conquer
savage men and nations only by the diffusion of Christian public opinion
among them, whereas the Christian nations, in order to conquer them,
do everything in their power to destroy the establishment of a Christian
public opinion&mdash;These unsuccessful experiments cannot be cited as a
proof of the impossibility of conquering men by Christianity&mdash;Violence
which corrupts public opinion only prevents the social organization from
becoming what it should be, and with the abolition of violence Christian
public opinion will be established&mdash;Whatever may take place when
violence has been abolished, the unknown future can be no worse than
the present, and therefore one need not fear it&mdash;To penetrate to the
unknown and move toward it is the essence of life.</p></blockquote>


<p>Christianity, faithfully interpreted, saps the foundations
of the civil law, and this was always understood
from the very outset. It was for this that Christ was
crucified; and until men felt the necessity for justifying
the establishment of the Christian state, they always
accepted that interpretation. The cleverly constructed
theories intended to reconcile the doctrines of Christianity
with that of the State date back to the time
when rulers of nations adopted a nominal external
Christianity. But in these times it is impossible for a
sincere and earnest man not to perceive the incompatibility
of the Christian doctrine of love, meekness of
spirit, and forgiveness of injuries, with the despotism,
the violence, and the wars of the State. The profession
of true Christianity not only forbids the recognition of
the State, but strikes at its very foundations.</p>

<p>But if it be true that Christianity is incompatible with
the State, one naturally asks which is the better
adapted to promote the well-being of mankind, the
system prescribed by the State, or the precepts of
Christianity?</p>

<p>There are those who affirm that the State organization
is the more indispensable; they declare that its
overthrow would check all human progress, that no
development is possible save through the channels of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
civil government, and that all those evils which we find
prevailing among nations who live under State laws are
not the result of the organization, which permits progress
and the attainment of the highest degree of civilization.</p>

<p>They who hold these views quote, in support of their
position, certain historical, philosophical, and even religious
arguments, which seem to them irrefutable. But
there are others who entertain views diametrically opposed
to these. For instance, they say that the fact of
the world having existed at one time without a government,
might be taken to prove the State to be only a
temporary condition; that the time was sure to come
when men would require a change, which time had now
arrived. To support their theory, these men in turn
adduce historical, philosophical, and religious arguments
which seem to them irrefutable.</p>

<p>Volumes may be and have been written in defense
of the former position, and of late years a great deal
has been written, and ably written too, from the opposite
standpoint.</p>

<p>It can neither be proved on the one hand, as the
partizans of the State claim, that its destruction would
be followed by a general upheaval, by robberies and
murders, and by the nullification of all social laws, and
the return of man to a condition of barbarism; nor on
the other, as the enemies of the State affirm, that man
has grown so virtuous and well disposed that, preferring
peace to enmity, he will no longer rob and murder his
neighbor; that he is quite able, without State assistance,
to establish a community, and conduct his own affairs;
and that the State itself, while assuming an air of protection,
is really exerting a demoralizing influence. It
is impossible to prove either one or the other by abstract
arguments. And naturally neither point can be proved
by experience, as it is a question first of all of getting
the requisite experience.</p>

<p>Whether or not the time has arrived for abolishing
the State is a question which could not be answered
were it not that we possess other means that will assist
us to settle it beyond dispute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>It needs no one to tell the young birds when it is
time to burst the shell; they know very well when
there is no longer room for them in the eggs, and begin
of their own accord to break the shell and leave it behind.
So it is with this question of a change in human
affairs. Has the time come for men to cast aside the
customs of the State and establish a new order? When
a man's inner consciousness has so developed that he
feels himself hampered by the requirements of the
State, and can no longer submit to the restraint, realizing
at the same time that he has ceased to need its
protecting care, the question whether or no men have
matured sufficiently to enable them to dispense with
the State is disposed of without reference to former
arguments. A man who has outgrown the State can
no more be coerced into submission to its laws than
can the fledgling be made to reënter its shell.</p>

<p>"The State may have been necessary at one time,
and for aught that I know it may even now serve the
purposes you mention," says the man who holds the
Christian life-conception. "I can only say that <em>I</em> have
no need of it, nor can <em>I</em> conform to its requirements.
You must decide for yourself whether it be advantageous
or no. I shall not attempt to generalize on
the subject with the expectation of proving my point.
I only recognize what I need and what I don't need;
what I can, and what I cannot do. I know, as far as
I am myself concerned, that <em>I</em> do not need to separate
from the men of other nations, and therefore I can
neither recognize an exclusive affiliation to this or that
one, nor acknowledge myself the subject of any one
government. I need none of the institutions established
by the State, and therefore I am not willing to surrender
the fruits of my labor in the form of taxes to
support institutions which I believe to be not only unnecessary
but positively injurious. I know that <em>I</em> need
neither magistrates, nor tribunals founded on and supported
by violence, and therefore I can have nothing
to do with them; I know that <em>I</em> feel no inclination to
attack other nations and put their citizens to death,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
neither do I wish to defend myself against them by
force of arms, and therefore I can take no part in wars
nor in preparations for wars. Doubtless there are men
who believe that all these things are an indispensable
part of human life,&mdash;I cannot argue with them,&mdash;but
I know that for me they have no meaning, and that
I will have nothing to do with them.</p>

<p>"And this is not a matter of personal selection, but
because I must obey the commands of Him who has
sent me into the world, and has given me an unmistakable
law by which I am to be guided through life."</p>

<p>Whatever arguments may be advanced to prove that
harm and probably disaster will accrue from abolishing
the authority of the State, the man who has already
outgrown the State ideal cannot possibly be bound
by it. And whatever arguments may be adduced to
prove its necessity, he can never return to it. He is
like the young bird who can never return to its outgrown
shell.</p>

<p>"But granting this to be true," say the partizans of
the existing order, "we cannot dispense with the
supremacy of the State until all men are Christians,
because even among those who claim the title there are
many who are very far from being Christians&mdash;evil-doers,
who seek their own gratification at the expense
of their fellow-men, and if the governments were overthrown,
so far from improving the condition of the
people, it would greatly add to their miseries. The
subversion of the State would be a misfortune, not only
where the minority are true Christians, but even supposing
the whole people to be so; while the neighboring
nations are still non-Christian, these latter would make
their lives a martyrdom by rapine and murder and all
manner of violence. It would serve only to provide the
vicious and unprincipled with an opportunity to oppress
the innocent. Therefore the State should not be abolished
until all the wicked have ceased from troubling,
which will not happen just at present. Hence, however
much certain individual Christians may wish to escape
from the authority of the State, the greater good of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
greater number demands its preservation." So say the
defenders of the State principle. "If it were not," they
say, "for State authority there would be no protection
against the malice and injustice of the oppressor; that
authority alone makes it possible to restrain the wicked."</p>

<p>But in uttering these sentiments the partizans of the
existing order take it for granted that they have proved
the truth of what they assert. When they declare that
the evil-doers would ride roughshod over the defenseless
and the innocent were it not for the authority of
the State, they imply that the governing power is
vested at the present time in a body of virtuous men,
who control all the wrong-doers. But this is a proposition
which must be proved. It could only be a
correct statement if we happened to resemble the inhabitants
of China, where it is popularly believed,
although the belief is not justified by fact, that the good
are always in authority, because should it become
known that the rulers are no better than those over
whom they rule, it is the duty of the citizens to overthrow
the government. But although this is supposed
to be one of the customs of China, it is not, nor would
it be possible for it to be so, since, in order to overthrow
a criminal government, one needs the power as well as
the right. Even in China this is a mere supposition,
and in our own Christian land we have never so much
as dreamed of it. As far as we are concerned, there is
no reason to believe that power is in the hands of the
virtuous and high-minded, rather than in those of men
who took it by violence and have held it for themselves
and their descendants. For surely it would be impossible
for a high-minded man to usurp authority by
violence and to continue to hold it.</p>

<p>In order to gain possession of power, and to retain it,
one must have a love for it, and the love of power is
incompatible with goodness; it accords with the opposite
qualities of pride, duplicity, and cruelty.</p>

<p>Both the origin and the maintenance of power depend
upon the exaltation of the individual, and the degradation
of the people by means of hypocrisy and fraud, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
prisons, fortresses, and murders. "If State authority
were to be abolished, then would the more wicked
people dominate over the less wicked," say the upholders
of State organization. But if the Egyptians
conquered the Hebrews, and the Persians the Egyptians,
and the Macedonians the Persians, and the Romans the
Greeks, and the barbarians the Romans, is it really
possible that the conquerors are always better than the
conquered? And so with political changes in the
State; is the power always transferred to the better
men? When Louis XVI. was deposed, and control
passed into the hands of Robespierre, and when, later,
he was in turn succeeded by Napoleon, was it the better
or the worse man who held the power? Again, were
they of Versailles or the communists the better men?
Charles the First or Cromwell? When Peter III.
reigned, or, after his murder, when Catharine ruled over
one part of Russia, and Pugatchov over the other&mdash;who
then was good and who was wicked?</p>

<p>All those in authority affirm that their office is required
in order that the unprincipled may be hindered
from oppressing the innocent, implying thereby that
they themselves, being virtuous, are protecting other
virtuous men from the malice of the evil-doer. To
possess power and to do violence are synonymous
terms; to do violence means doing something to which
the victim of violence objects, and which the aggressor
would resent were it directed against himself. Therefore
the possession of power really means doing unto
others what we should not like if it were done to ourselves,&mdash;that
is, harm.</p>

<p>Obedience signifies that a man holds patience to be
better than violence, and to choose patience rather than
violence means to be good, or, at least, not so wicked as
those who do unto others what they would not wish to
have done to themselves.</p>

<p>Therefore all the probabilities are that those in
authority were in past times, as they are in present,
worse men than those they ruled over. Doubtless there
are wicked men among those who submit to authority,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
but it is impossible that the better men should rule over
the worse.</p>

<p>This might be thought in pagan times, when the
definition of goodness was inaccurate; but with the clear
and exact conception of the qualities of good and evil
presented by Christianity before us we cannot imagine
it. If in the pagan world they who were more or less
good, and they who were more or less bad, might not
be easily distinguished, the characteristics of goodness
and wickedness have been so clearly defined by the
Christian conception that it is impossible to mistake
them. According to the doctrine of Christ, the good
are those who submit and are long-suffering, who do
not resist evil by violence, who forgive injuries, and love
their enemies; the wicked are the vainglorious, who
tyrannize, who are arrogant and violent with others.
Therefore, if we are guided by the doctrine of Christ,
we shall have no difficulty in deciding where to seek
the good and the wicked among rulers and subjects.
It is even absurd to speak of Christians as sovereigns or
rulers.</p>

<p>The non-Christians&mdash;that is, those to whom life is
but a matter of temporal welfare&mdash;must always rule
over the Christians, for whom life means self-denial and
disregard of temporal things.</p>

<p>And thus it has always been, and it has been manifested
more and more plainly as the Christian doctrine
has become more clearly defined and widespread.</p>

<p>The farther true Christianity extended, the firmer the
hold it gained on the consciousness of men, the less
possible it became for Christians to belong to the dominant
class, and the easier for non-Christians to gain the
ascendancy.</p>

<p>"To abolish the supremacy of the State before all
men have become true Christians would only afford the
wicked a chance to tyrannize over the good and maltreat
them with impunity," say the upholders of the existing
order.</p>

<p>It has always been the same from the beginning of the
world until this present time, and it always will be. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
<em>The wicked always rule over the good and do violence to them</em>.
Cain did violence to Abel, the astute Jacob betrayed
the trusting Esau, and was himself deceived by Laban;
Caiaphas and Pilate sat in judgment on Christ; the
Roman emperors ruled over Seneca, Epictetus, and
other high-minded Romans of those times; Ivan IV.
with his Opritchniks, the tipsy syphilitic Peter with his
clowns, the prostitute Catharine with her lovers, ruled
over the industrious, God-fearing Russian people of those
times, and trampled upon them. William rules the Germans,
Stambulov the Bulgarians, and the Russian officials
rule over the Russian people; the Germans ruled over
the Italians, and now they rule over the Hungarians and
the Slavs. The Turks ruled over the Greeks and now
rule over the Slavs, the English over the Hindoos, the
Mongolians over the Chinese.</p>

<p>So we see that whether the tyranny of the State is
or is not to be abolished, the position of the innocent,
who are oppressed by the tyrants, will not be materially
affected thereby.</p>

<p>Men are not to be frightened by being told that the
wicked will oppress the good, because that is the natural
course, and will never change.</p>

<p>The whole of pagan history is a mere narrative of
events wherein the wicked have got the upper hand, and,
once in power, by craft and cruelty have kept their hold
upon men, announcing themselves meanwhile as the
guardians of justice and the defenders of the innocent
against the oppressor. All revolutions are but the result
of the appropriation of power by the wicked and their
rule over the good. When the rulers say that if their
power were to be destroyed the evil-doers would tyrannize
over the innocent, what they really mean is that the
tyrants in power are reluctant to yield to those other
tyrants who would fain wrest from them their authority.
When they protest that this authority of theirs, which
is actually violence, is necessary to defend the people
against the possible tyranny of others,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> they are simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
denouncing themselves. The reason why violence is
dangerous is that, whenever it is employed, all the arguments
which the perpetrators advanced in their own defense
may be used against them with even greater force.
They talk of the violence done in the past, and more
frequently of future and imaginary violence, while they
themselves are the real offenders. "You say that men
committed robbery and murder in former times, and profess
anxiety lest all men be robbed or murdered unless
protected by your authority. This may or may not be
true, but the fact that you allow thousands of men to
perish in prisons by enforced labor, in fortresses, and
in exile, that your military requisitions ruin millions of
families and imperil, morally and physically, millions of
men, this is not a supposititious but an actual violence,
which, according to your own reasoning, should be resisted
by violence. And therefore, by your own admission,
the wicked ones, against whom one should use
violence, are yourselves." Thus should the oppressed
reply to their oppressors. And such are the language,
the thoughts, and the actions of non-Christians. Wherever
the oppressed are more wicked than the oppressor,
they attack and overthrow them whenever they are able;
or else&mdash;and this is more frequently the case&mdash;they
enter the ranks of the oppressors and take part in their
tyranny.</p>

<p>Thus the dangers of which the defenders of State
rights make a bugbear&mdash;that if authority were overthrown
the wicked would prevail over the good&mdash;potentially
exist at all times. The destruction of State
violence, in fact, never can, for this very reason, lead to
any real increase of violence on the part of the wicked
over the good.</p>

<p>If State violence disappeared, it is not unlikely that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
other acts of violence would be committed; but the sum
of violence can never be increased simply because the
power passes from the hands of one into those of another.</p>

<p>"State violence can never be abolished until all the
wicked disappear," say the advocates of the existing
order, by which they imply that there must always be
violence, because there will always be wicked people.
This could only prove true, supposing the oppressors to
be really beneficent, and supposing the true deliverance
of mankind from evil must be accomplished by violence.
Then, of course, violence could never cease. But as, on
the contrary, violence never really overcomes evil, and
since there is another way altogether to overcome it,
the assertion that violence will never cease is untrue.
Violence is diminishing, and clearly tending to disappear;
though not, as is claimed by the defenders of
the existing order, in consequence of the amelioration
of those who live under an oppressive government (their
condition really gets worse), but because the consciousness
of mankind is becoming more clear. Hence even
the wicked men who are in power are growing less and
less wicked, and will at last become so good that they
will be incapable of committing deeds of violence.</p>

<p>The reason why humanity marches forward is not
because the inferior men, having gained possession of
power, reform their subjects by arbitrary methods, as
is claimed both by Conservatives and Revolutionists, but
is due above all to the fact that mankind in general is
steadily, and with an ever increasing appreciation,
adopting the Christian life-conception. There is a
phenomenon observable in human life in a manner
analogous to that of boiling. Those who profess the
social life-conception are always ambitious to rule,
and struggle to attain power. In this struggle the
most gross and cruel, the least Christian elements of
society, bubble up, as it were, and rise, by reason of
their violence, into the ruling or upper classes of society.
But then is fulfilled what Christ prophesied: "Woe unto
you that are rich! Woe unto you that are full! Woe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
unto you, when all men shall speak well of you!" (Luke
vi. 24-26). The men who have attained power, and
glory, and riches, and who have realized all their
cherished aims, live to discover that all is vanity, and
gladly return to their former estate. Charles V., Ivan
the Terrible, Alexander I., having realized the evils of
power and its futility, renounced it because they recognized
it as a calamity, having lost all pleasure in the
deeds of violence which they formerly enjoyed.</p>

<p>But it is not alone kings like Charles V. and Alexander
I. who arrive at this disgust of power, but every
man who has attained the object of his ambition. Not
only the statesman, the general, the millionaire, the
merchant, but every official who has gained the position
for which he has longed this half score of years, every
well-to-do peasant who has saved one or two hundred
roubles, finds at last the same disillusion.</p>

<p>Not only individuals, but entire nations, mankind as
a whole, have passed through this experience.</p>

<p>The attractions of power and all it brings&mdash;riches,
honors, luxury&mdash;seem to men really worth struggling for
only until they are won; for no sooner does a man hold
them within his grasp than they manifest their own emptiness
and gradually lose their charm, like clouds, lovely
and picturesque in outline seen from afar, but no sooner
is one enveloped in them than all their beauty vanishes.</p>

<p>Men who have obtained riches and power, those who
have struggled for them, but more particularly those
who have inherited them, cease to be greedy for power
or cruel in its acquisition.</p>

<p>Having learned by experience, sometimes in one generation,
sometimes in several, how utterly worthless are
the fruits of violence, men abandon those vices acquired
by the passion for riches and power, and growing more
humane, they lose their positions, being crowded out by
others who are less Christian and more wicked; whereupon
they fall back into a stratum, which, though lower
in the social scale, is higher in that of morality, thus
increasing the mean level of Christian consciousness.
But straightway, the worse, the rougher, and less Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
elements rise to the surface, and being subject to
the same experience as their predecessors, after one or
two generations these men, too, recognize the hollowness
of violent ambitions, and, being penetrated with the
spirit of Christianity, fall back into the ranks of the
oppressed. These are in turn replaced by new oppressors,
less despotic than the former, but rougher
than those whom they oppress. So that although the
authority is to all outward seeming unchanged, yet the
number of those who have been driven by the exigencies
of life to adopt the Christian life-conception increases
with every change of rulers. They may be more harsh,
more cruel, and less Christian than their subjects; but
always men less and less violent replace their predecessors
in authority.</p>

<p>Violence chooses its instruments from among the
worst elements of society; men who gradually become
leavened, and, softened and changed for the better, are
returned into society.</p>

<p>Such is the process by means of which Christianity
takes fuller possession of men day by day. Christianity
enters into the consciousness of men in spite of the violence
of power, and even owing to that violence.</p>

<p>The argument of the defenders of the State, that if
power were abolished the wicked would tyrannize over
the good, not only fails to prove that the domination of
the wicked is a new thing to be dreaded,&mdash;as it exists
already,&mdash;but proves, on the contrary, that the tyranny
of the State, which allows the wicked to govern the good,
is itself the real evil which we ought to eradicate, and
which is constantly decreasing by the very nature of
things.</p>

<p>"But if State violence is not to cease until the rulers
have become so far Christianized that they will renounce
it of their own accord and no others will be found to
take their places,&mdash;if these things are coming to pass,"
say the defenders of the existing order, "when is it to
happen? If 1800 years have passed, and still so many
long to rule, it is wholly improbable that we shall soon
behold this change, if it ever takes place at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>"Even though there may be at present, as there always
have been, certain individuals who would not rule
if they could, who do not choose to benefit themselves
in that way, still the number of those who do prefer to
rule rather than to be ruled is so great that it is difficult
to imagine a time when the number will be exhausted.</p>

<p>"In order to accomplish the conversion of all men, to
induce each one to exchange the pagan for the Christian
life-conception, voluntarily resigning riches and
power, there being none left to profit by these, it would
be necessary that not only all the rude, half-barbarous
people, unfitted either to accept Christianity or follow
its precepts, who are always to be found in every Christian
community, should become Christians, but that all
savage and non-Christian nations, which are still numerous,
should also become Christian.</p>

<p>"Therefore were one to admit that the Christianizing
process may at some future time embrace all humanity,
we must still take into consideration the degree of progress
that has been made in 1800 years, and realize that
this can only happen after many centuries. Hence we
need not for the present trouble ourselves about the
overthrow of authority; all we have to do is to look to
it that it is in the best hands."</p>

<p>Thus reply the partizans of the existing system. And
this reasoning would be perfectly consistent, provided
that the transition of men from one life-conception to
another were only to be effected by the process of individual
conversion; that is to say, that each man, through
his personal experience, should realize the vanity of
power, and apprehend Christian truth. This process is
constantly going on, and in that way, one by one, men
are converted to Christianity.</p>

<p>But men do not become converted to Christianity
merely in this way; there is an exterior influence
brought to bear which accelerates the process. The
progression of mankind from one system of life to another
is accomplished not only gradually, as the sand
glides through the hour-glass, grain by grain, until all
has run out, but rather as water which enters an immersed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
vessel, at first slowly, at one side, then, borne
down by its weight, suddenly plunges, and at once fills
completely.</p>

<p>And this is what happens in human communities during
a change in their life-conception, which is equivalent
to the change from one organization to another. It is
only at first that men by degrees, one by one, accept
the new truth and obey its dictates; but after it has
been to a certain extent disseminated, it is accepted, not
through intuition, and not by degrees, but generally and
at once, and almost involuntarily.</p>

<p>And therefore the argument of the advocates of the
present system, that but a minority have embraced Christianity
during the last 1800 years, and that another 1800
years must pass away before the rest of mankind will
accept it, is erroneous. For one must take into consideration
another mode, in addition to the intuitive of
assimilating new truth, and of making the transition
from one mode of life to another. This other mode is
this: men assimilate a truth not alone because they may
have come to realize it through prophetic insight or
through individual experience, but the truth having been
spread abroad, those who dwell on a lower plane of intelligence
accept it at once, because of their confidence
in those who have received it and incorporated it in their
lives.</p>

<p>Every new truth that changes the manner of life and
causes humanity to move onward is at first accepted by
a very limited number, who grasp it by knowledge of it.
The rest of mankind, accepting on faith the former truth
upon which the existing system has been founded, is
always opposed to the spread of the new truth.</p>

<p>But as, in the first place, mankind is not stationary,
but is ever progressing, growing more and more familiar
with truth and approaching nearer to it in everyday
life: and secondly, as all men progress according to
their opportunities, age, education, nationality, beginning
with those who are more, and ending with those who are
less, capable of receiving new truth&mdash;the men nearest
those who have perceived the truth intuitively pass, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
by one, and with gradually diminishing intervals, over
to the side of the new truth. So, as the number of men
who acknowledge it increases, the truth itself becomes
more clearly manifested. The feeling of confidence in
the new truth increases in proportion to the numbers
who have accepted it. For, owing to the growing intelligibility
of the truth itself, it becomes easier for men
to grasp it, especially for those lower intellectually, until
finally the greater number readily adopt it, and help to
found a new <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i>.</p>

<p>The men who go over to the new truth, once it has
gained a certain hold, go over <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</i>, of one accord,
much as ballast is rapidly put into a ship to maintain its
equilibrium. If not ballasted, the vessel would not be
sufficiently immersed, and would change its position
every moment. This ballast, which at first may seem
superfluous and a hindrance to the progress of the ship,
is indispensable to its equipoise and motion.</p>

<p>Thus it is with the masses when, under the influence
of some new idea that has won social approval, they
abandon one system to adopt another, not singly, but in
a body. It is the inertia of this mass which impedes the
rapid and frequent transition from one system of life,
not ratified by wisdom, to another; and which for a long
time arrests the progress of every truth destined to become
a part of human consciousness.</p>

<p>It is erroneous, then, to argue that because only a
small percentage of the human race has in these eighteen
centuries adopted the Christian doctrine, that many,
many times eighteen centuries must elapse before the
whole world will accept it,&mdash;a period of time so remote
that we who are now living can have no interest in it. It
is unfair, because those men who stand on a lower plane
of development, whom the partizans of the existing
order represent as hindrances to the realization of the
Christian system of life, are those men who always go
over in a body to a truth accepted by those above them.</p>

<p>And therefore that change in the life of mankind, when
the powerful will give up their power without finding
any to assume it in their stead, will come to pass when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the Christian life-conception, rendered familiar, conquers,
not merely men one by one, but masses at a time.</p>

<p>"But even if it were true," the advocates of the existing
order may say, "that public opinion has the power
to convert the inert non-Christian mass of men, as well
as the corrupt and gross who are to be found in every
Christian community, how shall we know that a Christian
mode of life is born, and that State violence will be
rendered useless?</p>

<p>"After renouncing the despotism by which the existing
order has been maintained, in order to trust to the
vague and indefinite force of public opinion, we risk permitting
those savages, those existing among us, as well
as those outside, to commit robbery, murder, and other
outrages upon Christians.</p>

<p>"If even with the help of authority we have a hard
struggle against the anti-Christian elements ever ready
to overpower us, and destroy all the progress made by
civilization, how then could public opinion prove an
efficient substitute for the use of force, and avail for
our protection? To rely upon public opinion alone
would be as foolhardy as to let loose all the wild beasts
of a menagerie, because they seem inoffensive when in
their cages and held in awe by red-hot irons.</p>

<p>"Those men entrusted with authority, or born to rule
over others by the divine will of God, have no right to
imperil all the results of civilization, simply to make an
experiment, and learn whether public opinion can or
cannot be substituted for the safeguard of authority."</p>

<p>Alphonse Karr, a French writer, forgotten to-day,
once said, in trying to prove the impossibility of abolishing
the death penalty: "Que Messieurs les assassins
commencent par nous donner l'exemple." And I have
often heard this witticism quoted by persons who really
believed they were using a convincing and intellectual
argument against the suppression of the penalty of death.
Nevertheless, there could be no better argument against
the violence of government.</p>

<p>"Let the assassins begin by showing us an example,"
say the defenders of government authority. The assassins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
say the same, but with more justice. They say:
"Let those who have set themselves up as teachers and
guides show us an example by the suppression of legal
assassination, and we will imitate it." And this they say,
not by way of a jest, but in all seriousness, for such is in
reality the situation.</p>

<p>"We cannot cease to use violence while we are surrounded
by those who commit violence."</p>

<p>There is no more insuperable barrier at the present
time to the progress of humanity, and to the establishment
of a system that shall be in harmony with its present
conception of life, than this erroneous argument.</p>

<p>Those holding positions of authority are fully convinced
that men are to be influenced and controlled by
force alone, and therefore to preserve the existing system
they do not hesitate to employ it. And yet this very
system is supported, not by violence, but by public
opinion, the action of which is compromised by violence.
The action of violence actually weakens and destroys
that which it wishes to support.</p>

<p>At best, violence, if not employed as a vehicle for the
ambition of those in high places, condemns in the inflexible
form a law which public opinion has most probably
long ago repudiated and condemned; but there is
this difference, that while public opinion rejects and condemns
all acts that are opposed to the moral law, the
law supported by force repudiates and condemns only a
certain limited number of acts, seeming thus to justify
all acts of a like order which have not been included in
its formula.</p>

<p>From the time of Moses public opinion has regarded
covetousness, lust, and cruelty as crimes, and condemned
them as such. It condemns and repudiates every form
that covetousness may assume, not only the acquisition
of another man's property by violence, fraud, or cunning,
but the cruel abuse of wealth as well. It condemns all
kinds of lust, let it be impudicity with a mistress, a slave,
a divorced wife, or with one's wife; it condemns all cruelty,&mdash;blows,
bad usage, murder,&mdash;all cruelty, not only toward
human beings, but toward animals. Whereas, the law,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
based upon violence, attacks only certain forms of covetousness,
such as theft and fraud, and certain forms of
lust and cruelty, such as conjugal infidelity, assault, and
murder; and thus it seems to condone those manifestations
of covetousness, lust, and cruelty which do not fall
within its narrow limits.</p>

<p>But violence not only demoralizes public opinion, it
excites in the minds of men a pernicious conviction that
they move onward, not through the impulsion of a spiritual
power, which would help them to comprehend and
realize the truth by bringing them nearer to that moral
force which is the source of every progressive movement
of mankind,&mdash;but, by means of violence,&mdash;by the very
factor that not only impedes our progress toward truth,
but withdraws us from it. This is a fatal error, inasmuch
as it inspires in man a contempt for the fundamental
principle of his life,&mdash;spiritual activity,&mdash;and leads
him to transfer all his strength and energy to the
practice of external violence.</p>

<p>It is as though men would try to put a locomotive in
motion by turning its wheels with their hands, not knowing
that the expansion of steam was the real motive-power,
and that the action of the wheels was but the
effect, and not the cause. If by their hands and their
levers they move the wheels, it is but the semblance of
motion, and, if anything, injures the wheels and makes
them useless.</p>

<p>The same mistake is made by those who expect to
move the world by violence.</p>

<p>Men affirm that the Christian life cannot be established
save by violence, because there are still uncivilized
nations outside of the Christian world, in Africa
and Asia (some regard even the Chinese as a menace
of our civilization), and because, according to the new
theory of heredity, there exist in society congenital
criminals, savage and irredeemably vicious.</p>

<p>But the savages whom we find in our own community,
as well as those beyond its pale, with whom we
threaten ourselves and others, have never yielded to
violence, and are not yielding to it now. One people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
never conquered another by violence alone. If the victors
stood on a lower plane of civilization than the conquered,
they always adopted the habits and customs
of the latter, never attempting to force their own methods
of life upon them. It is by the influence of public
opinion, not by violence, that nations are reduced to
submission.</p>

<p>When a people have accepted a new religion, have
become Christians, or turned Mohammedans, it has
come to pass, not because it was made obligatory by
those in power (violence often produced quite the
opposite result), but because they were influenced by
public opinion. Nations constrained by violence to
accept the religion of the conqueror have never really
done so.</p>

<p>The same may be said in regard to the savage
elements found in all communities: neither severity nor
clemency in the matter of punishments, nor modifications
in the prison system, nor augmenting of the police
force, have either diminished or increased the aggregate
of crimes, which will only decrease through an evolution
in our manner of life. No severities have ever
succeeded in suppressing the vendetta, or the custom
of dueling in certain countries. However many of his
fellows may be put to death for thieving, the Tcherkess
continues to steal out of vainglory. No girl will marry
a Tcherkess who has not proved his daring by stealing
a horse, or at least a sheep. When men no longer fight
duels, and the Tcherkess cease to steal, it will not be
from fear of punishment (the danger of capital punishment
adds to the prestige of daring), but because public
manners will have undergone a change. The same
may be said of all other crimes. Violence can never
suppress that which is countenanced by general custom.
If public opinion would but frown upon violence, it
would destroy all its power.</p>

<p>What would happen if violence were not employed
against hostile nations and the criminal element in society
we do not know. But that the use of violence subdues
neither we do know through long experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>And how can we expect to subdue by violence nations
whose education, traditions, and even religious training
all tend to glorify resistence to the conqueror, and love
of liberty as the loftiest of virtues? And how is it
possible to extirpate crime by violence in the midst of
communities where the same act, regarded by the government
as criminal, is transformed into an heroic
exploit by public opinion?</p>

<p>Nations and races may be destroyed by violence&mdash;it
has been done. They cannot be subdued.</p>

<p>The power transcending all others which has influenced
individuals and nations since time began, that
power which is the convergence of the invisible, intangible,
spiritual forces of all humanity, is public opinion.</p>

<p>Violence serves but to enervate this influence, disintegrating
it, and substituting for it one not only useless,
but pernicious to the welfare of humanity.</p>

<p>In order to win over all those outside the Christian
fold, all the Zulus, the Manchurians, the Chinese, whom
many consider uncivilized, and the uncivilized among ourselves,
there is <em>only one way</em>. This is by the diffusion of
a Christian mode of thought, which is only to be accomplished
by a Christian life, Christian deeds, a Christian
example. But instead of employing this <em>one way</em> of winning
those who have remained outside the fold of Christianity,
men of our epoch have done just the opposite.</p>

<p>In order to convert uncivilized nations who do us no
harm, whom we have no motive for oppressing, we
ought, above all, to leave them in peace, and act upon
them only by our showing them an example of the
Christian virtues of patience, meekness, temperance,
purity, and brotherly love. Instead of this we begin
by seizing their territory, and establishing among them
new marts for our commerce, with the sole view of
furthering our own interests&mdash;we, in fact, rob them;
we sell them wine, tobacco, and opium, and thereby
demoralize them; we establish our own customs among
them, we teach them violence and all its lessons; we
teach them the animal law of strife, that lowest depth
of human degradation, and do all that we can to conceal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
the Christian virtues we possess. Then, having
sent them a score of missionaries, who gabble an absurd
clerical jargon, we quote the results of our attempt
to convert the heathen as an indubitable proof that the
truths of Christianity are not adaptable to everyday
life.</p>

<p>And as for those whom we call criminals, who live
in our midst, all that has just been said applies equally
to them. There is only <em>one way</em> to convert them, and
that is by means of a public opinion founded on true
Christianity, accompanied by the example of a sincere
Christian life. And by way of preaching this Christian
gospel and confirming it by Christian example, we imprison,
we execute, guillotine, hang; we encourage the
masses in idolatrous religions calculated to stultify
them; the government authorizes the sale of brain-destroying
poisons&mdash;wine, tobacco, opium; prostitution
is legalized; we bestow land upon those who need it
not; surrounded by misery, we display in our entertainments
an unbridled extravagance; we render impossible
in such ways any semblance of a Christian life,
and do our best to destroy Christian ideas already established;
and then, after doing all we can to demoralize
men, we take and confine them like wild beasts in
places from which they cannot escape, and where they
will become more brutal than ever; or we murder the
men we have demoralized, and then use them as an
example to illustrate and prove our argument that people
are only to be controlled by violence.</p>

<p>Even so does the ignorant physician act, who, having
placed his patient in the most unsanitary conditions, or
having administered to him poisonous drugs, afterward
contends that his patient has succumbed to the disease,
when had he been left to himself he would have recovered
long ago.</p>

<p>Violence, which men regard as an instrument for the
support of Christian life, on the contrary, prevents the
social system from reaching its full and perfect development.
The social system is such as it is, not because of
violence, but in spite of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>Therefore the defenders of the existing social system
are self-deceived when they say that, since violence
barely holds the evil and un-Christian elements of society
in awe, its subversion, and the substitution of the
moral influence of public opinion, would leave us helpless
in face of them. They are wrong, because violence
does not protect mankind; but it deprives men of the
only possible chance of an effectual defense by the establishment
and propagation of the Christian principle of life.</p>

<p>"But how can one discard the visible and tangible
protection of the policeman with his baton, and trust to
invisible, intangible public opinion? And, moreover, is
not its very existence problematical? We are all familiar
with the actual state of things; whether it be good
or bad we know its faults, and are accustomed to them;
we know how to conduct ourselves, how to act in the
present conditions; but what will happen when we renounce
the present organization, and confide ourselves to
something invisible, intangible, and utterly unfamiliar?"</p>

<p>Men dread the uncertainty into which they would
plunge if they were to renounce the familiar order of
things. Certainly were our situation an assured and
stable one, it would be well to dread the uncertainties
of change. But so far from enjoying an assured position,
we know that we are on the verge of a catastrophe.</p>

<p>If we are to give way to fear, then let it be before
something that is really fearful, and not before something
that we imagine may be so.</p>

<p>In fearing to make an effort to escape from conditions
that are fatal to us, only because the future is obscure
and unknown, we are like the passengers of a sinking
ship who crowd into the cabin and refuse to leave it,
because they have not the courage to enter the boat
that would carry them to the shore; or like sheep who,
in fear of the fire that has broken out in the farmyard,
huddle together in a corner and will not go out through
the open gate.</p>

<p>How can we, who stand on the threshold of a shocking
and devastating social war, before which, as those
who are preparing for it tell us, the horrors of 1793 will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
pale, talk seriously about the danger threatened by the
natives of Dahomey, the Zulus, and others who live
far away, and who have no intention of attacking us;
or about the few thousands of malefactors, thieves, and
murderers&mdash;men whom we have helped to demoralize,
and whose numbers are not decreased by all our courts,
prisons, and executions?</p>

<p>Moreover, this anxiety lest the visible protection of
the police be overthrown, is chiefly confined to the
inhabitants of cities&mdash;that is, to those who live under
abnormal and artificial conditions. Those who live normally
in the midst of nature, dealing with its forces,
require no such protection; they realize how little avails
violence to protect us from the real danger that surrounds
us. There is something morbid in this fear,
which arises chiefly from the false conditions in which
most of us have grown up and continue to live.</p>

<p>A doctor to the insane related how, one day in summer,
when he was about to leave the asylum, the patients
accompanied him as far as the gate that led into
the street.</p>

<p>"Come with me into town!" he proposed to them.</p>

<p>The patients agreed, and a little band followed him.
But the farther they went through the streets where
they met their sane fellow-men moving freely to and
fro, the more timid they grew, and pressed more closely
around the doctor. At last they begged to be taken
back to the asylum, to their old but accustomed mode
of insane life, to their keepers and their rough ways, to
strait jackets and solitary confinement.</p>

<p>And thus it is with those whom Christianity is waiting
to set free, to whom it offers the untrammeled
rational life of the future, the coming century; they
huddle together and cling to their insane customs, to
their factories, courts, and prisons, their executioners,
and their warfare.</p>

<p>They ask: "What security will there be for us when
the existing order has been swept away? What kind
of laws are to take the place of those under which we
are now living? Not until we know exactly how our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
life is to be ordered will we take a single step toward
making a change." It is as if a discoverer were to
insist upon a detailed description of the region he is
about to explore. If the individual man, while passing
from one period of his life to another, could read the
future and know just what his whole life were to be, he
would have no reason for living. And so it is with the
career of humanity. If, upon entering a new period, a
program detailing the incidents of its future existence
were possible, humanity would stagnate.</p>

<p>We cannot know the conditions of the new order of
things, because we have to work them out for ourselves.
The meaning of life is to search out that which is hidden,
and then to conform our activity to our new
knowledge. This is the life of the individual as it is the
life of humanity.</p>

<h3>CHRISTIAN PUBLIC OPINION ALREADY ARISES IN OUR
SOCIETY, AND WILL INEVITABLY DESTROY THE SYSTEM
OF VIOLENCE OF OUR LIFE. WHEN THIS WILL COME
ABOUT</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">The condition and organization of our society is shocking; it is upheld by
public opinion, but can be abolished by it&mdash;Men's views in regard to
violence have already changed; the number of men ready to serve the
governments decreases, and functionaries of government themselves
begin to be ashamed of their position, to the point of often not fulfilling
their duties&mdash;These facts, signs of the birth of a public opinion, which,
in becoming more and more general, will lead finally to the impossibility
of finding men willing to serve governments&mdash;It becomes more and
more clear that such positions are no longer needed&mdash;Men begin to
realize the uselessness of all the institutions of violence; and if this is
realized by a few men, it will later be understood by all&mdash;The time
when the deliverance will be accomplished is unknown, but it depends
on men themselves; it depends on how much each man is willing to
live by the light that is within him.</p></blockquote>


<p>The position of the Christian nations, with their
prisons, their gallows, their factories, their accumulations
of capital, taxes, churches, taverns, and public
brothels, their increasing armaments, and their millions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
of besotted men, ready, like dogs, to spring at a word
from the master, would be shocking indeed if it were
the result of violence; but such a state of things is, before
all, the result of public opinion; and what has been
established by public opinion not only may be, but will
be, overthrown by it.</p>

<p>Millions and millions of money, tens of millions of disciplined
soldiers, marvelous weapons of destruction, an
infinitely perfected organization, legions of men charged
to delude and hypnotize the people,&mdash;this is all under
the control of men who believe that this organization is
advantageous for them, who know that without it they
would disappear, and who therefore devote all their
energy to its maintenance. What an indomitable array
of power it seems! And yet we have but to realize
whither we are fatally tending, for men to become as
much ashamed of acts of violence, and to profit by them,
as they are ashamed now of dishonesty, theft, beggary,
cowardice; and the whole complicated and apparently
omnipotent system will die at once without any struggle.
To accomplish this transformation it is not necessary that
any new ideas should find their way into the human consciousness,
but only that the mist which now veils the
true significance of violence should lift, in order that
the growing Christian public opinion and methods may
conquer the methods of the pagan world. And this is
gradually coming to pass. We do not observe it, as we
do not observe the movement of things when we are
turning, and everything around us is turning as well.</p>

<p>It is true that the social organization seems for the
most part as much under the influence of violence as it
seemed a thousand years ago, and in respect of armaments
and war seems even more; but the Christian view
of life is already having its effect. The withered tree,
to all appearance, stands as firmly as ever; it seems
even firmer, because it has grown harder, but it is
already rotten at the heart and preparing to fall. It
is the same with the present mode of life based upon
violence. The outward position of man appears the
same. There are the same oppressors, the same oppressed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
but the feeling of both classes in regard to
their respective positions has undergone a change.
The oppressors, that is, those who take part in the
government, and those who are benefited by oppression,
the wealthy classes, do not constitute, as formerly,
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élite</i> of society, nor does their condition suggest that
ideal of human prosperity and greatness to which formerly
all the oppressed aspired. Now, it often happens
that the oppressors renounce of their own accord the
advantages of their position, choosing the position of
the oppressed, and endeavor, by the simplicity of their
mode of life, to resemble them.</p>

<p>Not to speak of those offices and positions generally
considered contemptible, such as that of the spy, the
detective, the usurer, or the keeper of a tavern, a great
many of the positions held by the oppressors, and formerly
considered honorable, such as those of police
officers, courtiers, judges, administrative functionaries,
ecclesiastical or military, masters on a large scale, and
bankers, are not only considered little enviable, but are
already avoided by estimable men. Already there are
men who choose to renounce such once envied positions,
preferring others which, although less advantageous,
are not associated with violence.</p>

<p>It is not merely such as these who renounce their privileges;
men influenced, not by religious motives, as was
the case in former ages, but by growing public opinion,
refuse to accept fortunes fallen to them by inheritance,
because they believe that a man ought to possess only
the fruits of his own labor.</p>

<p>High-minded youths, not as yet depraved by life, when
about to choose a career, prefer the professions of doctors,
engineers, teachers, artists, writers, or even of
farmers, who live by their daily toil, to the positions
of judges, administrators, priests, soldiers in the pay of
government; they decline even the position of living on
their income.</p>

<p>Most of the monuments at the present day are no
longer erected in honor of statesmen or generals, still
less of men of wealth, but to scientists, artists, and inventors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
to men who not only had nothing in common
with government or authority, but who frequently opposed
it. It is to their memory that the arts are thus
consecrated.</p>

<p>The class of men who will govern, and of rich men,
tends every day to grow less numerous, and so far as
intellect, education, and especially morality, are concerned,
rich men and men in power are not the most
distinguished members of society, as was the case in
olden times. In Russia and Turkey, as in France and
America, notwithstanding the frequent changes of officials,
the greater number are often covetous and venal,
and so little to be commended from the point of view
of morality that they do not satisfy even the elementary
exigencies of honesty demanded in government posts.
Thus one hears often the ingenuous complaints of those
in government that the best men among us, strangely
enough as it seems to them, are always found among
those opposed to them. It is as if one complained that
it is not the nice, good people who become hangmen.</p>

<p>Rich men of the present day, as a general thing, are
mere vulgar amassers of wealth, for the most part having
but little care beyond that of increasing their capital,
and that most often by impure means; or are the
degenerate inheritors, who, far from playing an important
part in society, often incur general contempt.</p>

<p>Many positions have lost their ancient importance.
Kings and emperors now hardly direct at all; they seldom
effect internal changes or modify external policy,
leaving the decision of such questions to the departments
of State, or to public opinion. Their function is
reduced to being the representatives of state unity and
power. But even this duty they begin to neglect. Most
of them not only fail to maintain themselves in their
former unapproachable majesty, but they grow more
and more democratic, they prefer even to be bourgeois;
they lay down thus their last distinction, destroying precisely
what they are expected to maintain.</p>

<p>The same may be said of the army. The high officers,
instead of encouraging the roughness and cruelty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
of the soldiers, which befit their occupation, promote
the diffusion of education among them, preach humanity,
often sympathize with the socialistic ideas of the
masses, and deny the utility of war. In the late conspiracies
against the Russian government many of those
concerned were military men. It often happens, as it
did recently, that the troops, when called upon to establish
order, refuse to fire on the people. The barrack
code of ideas is frankly deprecated by military men
themselves, who often enough make it the subject of
derision.</p>

<p>The same may be said of judges and lawyers. Judges,
whose duty it is to judge and condemn criminals, conduct
their trials in such a fashion as to prove them innocent;
thus the Russian government, when it desires the
condemnation of those it wishes to punish, never confides
them to the ordinary tribunals; it tries them by
court-martial, which is but a parody of justice. The
same may be said of lawyers, who often refuse to accuse,
and, twisting round the law, defend those they should
accuse. Learned jurists, whose duty it is to justify the
violence of authority, deny more and more frequently
the right of punishment, and in its place introduce theories
of irresponsibility, often prescribing, not punishment,
but medical treatment for so-called criminals.</p>

<p>Jailers and turnkeys in convict prisons often become
the protectors of those it is a part of their business to
torture. Policemen and detectives are constantly saving
those they ought to arrest. Ecclesiastics preach
tolerance; they often deny the right of violence, and the
more educated among them attempt in their sermons
to avoid the deception which constitutes all the meaning
of their position, and which they are expected to
preach. Executioners refuse to perform their duty;
the result is that often in Russia death-warrants cannot
be carried out for lack of executioners, for, notwithstanding
all the advantages of the position, the candidates,
who are chosen from convicts, diminish in
number every year. Governors, commissioners, and tax-collectors,
pitying the people, often try to find pretexts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
for remitting the taxes. Rich men no longer dare to
use their wealth for themselves alone, but sacrifice a
part of it to social charities. Landowners establish hospitals
and schools on their estates, and some even renounce
their estates and bestow them on the cultivators
of the soil, or establish agricultural colonies upon them.
Manufacturers and mill-owners found schools, hospitals,
and savings-banks, institute pensions, and build houses
for the workmen; some start associations of which the
profits are equally divided among all. Capitalists expend
a portion of their wealth on educational, artistic, and
philanthropic institutions for the public benefit. Many
men who are unwilling to part with their riches during
their lifetime bequeath them to public institutions.</p>

<p>These facts might be deemed the result of chance
were it not that they all originate from one source, as,
when certain trees begin to bud in the spring of the
year, we might believe it accidental, only we know the
cause; and that if on some trees the buds begin to
swell, we know that the same thing will happen to all
of them.</p>

<p>Even so is it in regard to Christian public opinion
and its manifestations. If this public opinion already
influences some of the more sensitive men, and makes
each one in his own sphere decline the advantages
obtained by violence or its use, it will continue to influence
men more and more, until it brings about a
change in their mode of life and reconciles it with that
Christian consciousness already possessed by the most
advanced.</p>

<p>And if there are already rulers who do not venture
on any undertaking on their own responsibility, and
who try to be like ordinary men rather than monarchs,
who declare themselves ready to give up their prerogatives
and become the first citizens of their country, and
soldiers who, realizing all the sin and evil of war, do
not wish to kill either foreigners or their fellow-countrymen,
judges and lawyers who do not wish to accuse
and condemn criminals, priests who evade preaching
lies, tax-gatherers who endeavor to fulfil as gently as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
possible what they are called upon to do, and rich men
who give up their wealth, then surely it will ultimately
come to pass that other rulers, soldiers, priests, and
rich men will follow their example. And when there
are no more men ready to occupy positions supported
by violence, the positions themselves will cease to
exist.</p>

<p>But this is not the only way by which public opinion
leads toward the abolition of the existing system, and
the substitution of a new one. As the positions supported
by violence become by degrees less and less
attractive, and there are fewer and fewer applicants to
fill them, their uselessness becomes more and more
apparent.</p>

<p>We have to-day the same rulers and governments,
the same armies, courts of law, tax-gatherers, priests,
wealthy landowners, manufacturers, and capitalists as
formerly, but their relative positions are changed.</p>

<p>The same rulers go about to their various interviews,
they have the same meetings, hunts, festivities, balls, and
uniforms; the same diplomatists have the same conversations
about alliances and armies; the same parliaments,
in which Eastern and African questions are discussed,
and questions in regard to alliances, ruptures, "Home
Rule," the eight-hour day. Changes of ministry take
place just as of old, accompanied by the same speeches
and incidents. But to those who know how an article
in a newspaper changes perhaps the position of
affairs more than dozens of royal interviews and parliamentary
sessions, it becomes more and more evident
that it is not these meetings, interviews, and parliamentary
discussions that control affairs, but something
independent of all this, something which has no local
habitation.</p>

<p>The same generals, officers, soldiers, cannon, fortresses,
parades, and evolutions. But one year elapses,
ten, twenty years elapse, and there is no war. And
troops are less and less to be relied on to suppress insurrection,
and it becomes more and more evident that
generals, officers, and soldiers are only figure-heads in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
triumphal processions, the plaything of a sovereign, a
sort of unwieldy and expensive <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps-de-ballet</i>.</p>

<p>The same lawyers and judges, and the same sessions,
but it becomes more and more evident that as civil
courts make decisions in a great variety of causes without
anxiety about purely legal justice, and that criminal
courts are useless, because the punishment does not
produce the desired result, therefore these institutions
have no other object than the maintenance of men incapable
of doing other things more useful.</p>

<p>The same priests, bishops, churches, and synods, but
it becomes more and more evident to all that these men
themselves have long since ceased to believe what they
preach, and are therefore unable to persuade any one
of the necessity of believing what they no longer believe
themselves.</p>

<p>The same tax-gatherers, but more and more incapable
of extorting money from the people by force, and it
becomes more and more evident that, without such collectors,
it would be possible to obtain by voluntary
contribution all that is required for social needs.</p>

<p>The same rich men, and yet it becomes more and
more evident that they can be useful only when they
cease to be personal administrators of their possessions,
and surrender to society their wealth in whole or part.</p>

<p>When this becomes as plain to all men as it now is
to a few, the question will naturally arise: Why should
we feed and support all those emperors, kings, presidents,
members of departments, and ministers, if all
their interviews and conversations amount to nothing?
Would it not be better, as some wit expressed it, to set
up an india-rubber queen?</p>

<p>And of what use to us are armies, with their generals,
their musicians, their horses, and drums? Of
what use are they when there is no war, when no one
wishes to conquer anybody else? And even if there
were a war, other nations would prevent us from reaping
its advantages; while upon their compatriots the
troops would refuse to fire.</p>

<p>And what is the use of judges and attorneys whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
decisions in civil cases are not according to the law,
and who, in criminal ones, are aware that punishments
are of no avail?</p>

<p>And of what use are tax-gatherers who are reluctant
to collect the taxes, when all that is needed could be
contributed without their assistance?</p>

<p>And where is the use of a clergy which has long
ceased to believe what it preaches?</p>

<p>And of what use is capital in the hands of private
individuals when it can be beneficial only when it becomes
public property? Having once asked all these
questions, men cannot but arrive at the conclusion that
institutions which have lost their usefulness should no
longer be supported.</p>

<p>And furthermore, men who themselves occupy positions
of privilege come to see the necessity of abandoning
them.</p>

<p>One day, in Moscow, I was present at a religious
discussion which is usually held during St. Thomas's
week, near the church in the Okhotny Ryad. A group
of perhaps twenty men had gathered on the pavement,
and a serious discussion concerning religion was in
progress. Meanwhile, in the nobles' club near at hand,
a concert was taking place, and a police-officer, having
noticed the group of people gathered near the church,
sent a mounted policeman to order them to disperse,&mdash;not
that the police-officer cared in the least whether
the group stayed where it was or dispersed. The
twenty men who had gathered inconvenienced no one,
but the officer had been on duty all the morning and
felt obliged to do something. The young policeman,
a smart-looking fellow, with his right arm akimbo and
a clanking sword, rode up to us, calling out in an
imperative tone: "Disperse, you fellows! What business
have you to gather there?" Every one turned to
look at him, while one of the speakers, a modest-looking
man in a peasant's coat, replied calmly and
pleasantly: "We are talking about business, and there
is no reason why we should disperse; it might be better
for you, my young friend, if you were to jump off from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
your horse and to listen to us. Very likely it would
do you good;" and turning away he continued the conversation.
The policeman turned his horse without a
word and rode away.</p>

<p>Such scenes as this must be of frequent occurrence in
countries where violence is employed. The officer was
bored; he had nothing to do, and the poor fellow was
placed in a position where he felt in duty bound to give
orders. He was deprived of a rational human existence;
he could do nothing but look on and give orders, give
orders and look on, although both were works of supererogation.
It will not be long before all those unfortunate
rulers, ministers, members of parliaments, governors,
generals, officers, bishops, priests, and even rich men,
will find themselves&mdash;indeed they have already done so&mdash;in
precisely the same position. Their sole occupation
consists in issuing orders; they send out their subordinates,
like the officer who sent the policeman to interfere
with the people; and as the people with whom
they interfere ask not to be interfered with, this seems
to their official intelligence only to prove that they are
very necessary.</p>

<p>But the time will surely come when it will be perfectly
evident to every one that they are not only useless, but
an actual impediment, and those whose course they obstruct
will say gently and pleasantly, like the man in
the peasant's coat: "We beg that you will let us alone."
Then the subordinates as well as their instructors will
find themselves compelled to take the good advice that
is offered them, cease to prance about among men with
their arms akimbo, and having discarded their glittering
livery, listen to what is said among men, and unite
with them to help to promote the serious work of the
world.</p>

<p>Sooner or later the time will surely come when all the
present institutions supported by violence will cease to
be; their too evident uselessness, absurdity, and even
unseemliness, will finally destroy them.</p>

<p>There must come a time when the same thing that
happened to the king in Andersen's fairy tale, "The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
King's New Clothes," will happen to men occupying
positions created by violence.</p>

<p>The tale tells of a king who cared enormously for
new clothes, and to whom one day came two tailors who
agreed to make him a suit woven from a wonderful stuff.
The king engaged them and they set to work, saying
that the stuff possessed the remarkable quality of becoming
invisible to any one unfit for the office he holds.
The courtiers came to inspect the work of the tailors,
but could see nothing, because these men were drawing
their needles through empty space. However, remembering
the consequences, they all pretended to see the
cloth and to be very much pleased with it. Even
the king himself praised it. The hour appointed for the
procession when he was to walk wearing his new garment
arrived. The king took off his clothes and put on
the new ones&mdash;that is, he remained naked all the while,
and thus he went in procession. But remembering the
consequences, no one had the courage to say that he was
not dressed, until a little child, catching sight of the
naked king, innocently exclaimed, "But he has nothing
on!" Whereupon all the others who had known this
before, but had not acknowledged it, could no longer
conceal the fact.</p>

<p>Thus will it be with those who, through inertia, continue
to fill offices that have long ceased to be of any
consequence, until some chance observer, who happens
not to be engaged, as the Russian proverb has it, in
"washing one hand with the other," will ingenuously
exclaim, "It is a long time since these men were good
for anything!"</p>

<p>The position of the Christian world, with its fortresses,
cannon, dynamite, guns, torpedoes, prisons, gallows,
churches, factories, custom-houses, and palaces is monstrous.
But neither fortresses nor cannon nor guns by
themselves can make war, nor can the prisons lock their
gates, nor the gallows hang, nor the churches themselves
lead men astray, nor the custom-houses claim their dues,
nor palaces and factories build and support themselves;
all these operations are performed by men. And when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
men understand that they need not make them, then
these things will cease to be.</p>

<p>And already men are beginning to understand this.
If not yet understood by all, it is already understood by
those whom the rest of the world eventually follows.
And it is impossible to cease to understand what once
has been understood, and the masses not only can, but
inevitably must, follow where those who have understood
have already led the way.</p>

<p>Hence the prophecy: that a time will come when all
men will hearken unto the word of God, will forget the
arts of war, will melt their swords into plowshares
and their lances into reaping-hooks;&mdash;which, being
translated, means when all the prisons, the fortresses,
the barracks, the palaces, and the churches will remain
empty, the gallows and the cannon will be useless.
This is no longer a mere Utopia, but a new and definite
system of life, toward which mankind is progressing
with ever increasing rapidity.</p>

<p>But when will it come?</p>

<p>Eighteen hundred years ago Christ, in answer to this
question, replied that the end of the present world&mdash;that
is, of the pagan system&mdash;would come when the
miseries of man had increased to their utmost limit; and
when, at the same time, the good news of the Kingdom
of Heaven&mdash;that is, of the possibility of a new system,
one not founded upon violence&mdash;should be proclaimed
throughout the earth.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>"But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not
the angels of heaven, but my Father only,"<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> said Christ.
"Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your
Lord doth come."</p>

<p>When will the hour arrive? Christ said that we cannot
know. And for that very reason we should hold
ourselves in readiness to meet it, as the goodman should
watch his house against thieves, or like the virgins who
await with their lamps the coming of the bridegroom;
and, moreover, we should work with all our might to
hasten the coming of that hour, as the servants should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
use the talents they have received that they may increase.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>And there can be no other answer. The day and the
hour of the advent of the Kingdom of God men cannot
know, since the coming of that hour depends only on
men themselves.</p>

<p>The reply is like that of the wise man who, when
the traveler asked him how far he was from the city,
answered, "Go on!"</p>

<p>How can we know if it is still far to the goal toward
which humanity is aiming, when we do not know how it
will move toward it; that it depends on humanity whether
it moves steadily onward or pauses, whether it accelerates
or retards its pace.</p>

<p>All that we can know is what we who form humanity
should or should not do in order to bring about this
Kingdom of God. And that we all know; for each one
has but to begin to do his duty, each one has but to live
according to the light that is within him, to bring about
the immediate advent of the promised Kingdom of God,
for which the heart of every man yearns.</p>

nor cowardice, nor lack of comprehension or of moral sense&mdash;They do
these things because they think them necessary to maintain the existing

the belief of the necessity and immutability of the existing order of things
is founded&mdash;For the upper classes it is based on the advantages it affords
them&mdash;But what compels men of the lower classes to believe in the
immutability of this system, when they derive no advantage from it, and
maintain it with acts contrary to their conscience?&mdash;The reason lies in
the deceit practised by the upper classes upon the lower in regard to the
necessity of the existing order, and the legitimacy of acts of violence for
its maintenance&mdash;General deception&mdash;Special deception&mdash;The conscription.</p></blockquote>

loss of consciousness of moral responsibility is also due to a mistaken

which is already in contradiction to the modern, is maintained only
through torpor of conscience, induced by auto-suggestion among the
upper classes, and by the hypnotization of the lower&mdash;The conscience
or intelligent consciousness of these men may awaken, and there are
instances when it does awaken; therefore it cannot be said that any
one of them will, or will not, do what he sets out to do&mdash;Everything

<p>I was just putting the finishing touches to this two
years' work when, on the 9th day of September,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> I had
occasion to go by rail to visit districts in the governments
of Tula and Ryazan, where certain peasants were
suffering from last year's famine, and others were enduring
still greater suffering from the same causes this
year.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> At one of the stations the train in which I was
a passenger met the express, which carried the Governor
and troops supplied with rods and loaded rifles for
torturing and murdering the famine-stricken peasants.</p>

<p>Although corporal punishment was legally abolished
in Russia thirty years ago, the custom of flogging as a
means of making the decisions of authority respected
has been revived, and has of late been frequently employed.
I had heard of it, had read in the papers of
the frightful tortures of which the Governor of Nijni-Novgorod,
Baranov, has gone so far as to boast, and
of the tortures that have been inflicted in Tchernigov,
Tambov, Saratov, Astrakhan, and Orel, but I had
never yet witnessed, as I did now, how these things
were actually done.</p>

<p>And I myself saw well-meaning Russians, penetrated
with the spirit of Christ, but armed with muskets and
carrying rods, on their way to murder and torture their
starving brothers.</p>

<p>The pretext was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>On the estate of a rich landowner, upon a piece of
ground held by him in common with the peasants, a
forest had been allowed to grow. (When I say that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
the forest "grew," I mean that the peasants had not
only planted it, but had continued to take care of it.)
They had always had the use of it, and therefore looked
upon it as their own, or at least as common property;
but the landowner, confiscating it entirely to himself,
began to cut down the trees. The peasants lodged a
complaint. The judge of the lower court pronounced
an illegal decision (I call it illegal on the authority of
the Procureur<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and the Governor, who surely ought to
understand the case) in favor of the landowner. The
higher courts, as well as the Senate, although they could
see that the case had been unfairly tried, confirmed the
decision, and the wood was awarded to the landowner,
who continued to fell the trees. But the peasants, believing
it impossible that such an injustice could be perpetrated
by the higher magistrates, refused to submit
to the decision, and drove away the workmen sent to
cut down the trees, saying that the forest belonged to
them, and that they would appeal to the Czar himself
before they would allow it to be touched.</p>

<p>The case was reported to St. Petersburg, from whence
the Governor received the order to enforce the decision
of the courts, and in order to execute the command,
asked for troops.</p>

<p>Hence these soldiers who, armed with bayonets and
provided with cartridges and rods expressly prepared
for the occasion and stored in one of the vans, were on
their way to enforce the decision of the higher authorities.
The execution of an order from the ruling powers
can be accomplished either by threats of torture and
death, or by the enforcement of those threats, according
to the degree of resistance on the part of the people.</p>

<p>If, for instance, in Russia (it is practically the same
in other lands where state authority and the rights of
ownership exist), the peasants offer to resist, the result
is as follows: The superior officer makes a speech and
orders them to obey. The excited crowd, accustomed
to be duped by those in high places, understands not
a word that the representative of authority is saying in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
his official, conventional language, and is by no means
pacified. Whereupon the commanding officer declares
that unless they submit and disperse, he will be forced
to have recourse to arms. If the crowd still refuses to
yield and does not disperse, he orders his men to load
the muskets and to fire over their heads, and then, if the
peasants still stand their ground, he orders the soldiers
to aim at the crowds; they fire, and men fall wounded
and killed in the street. The crowd is dispersed, the
soldiers, carrying out the orders of their commanders,
having laid hands upon those whom they suppose to be
the chief instigators, and arrested them. The dying,
stained with blood, the wounded, mutilated, and dead,
among whom are often women and children, are picked
up. The dead are buried, the wounded sent to the
hospitals. Those who are supposed to be the ringleaders
are taken to the city and court-martialed, and
if proved that they have used violence, they are summarily
hung. This has happened in Russia repeatedly,
and similar scenes must take place wherever the system
of government is based upon violence. Such is
the course adopted in cases of revolt.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, the peasants submit, the scene
that ensues is entirely original and peculiarly Russian.
The Governor, on his arrival at the place, either quarters
the soldiers in the different houses of the village,
where their maintenance ruins the peasants, or, satisfied
by threatening the people, he graciously pardons
them and departs. Or, as more frequently happens, he
addresses the multitude, upbraids it for disobedience,
and announces that the ringleaders must be punished;
he seizes a certain number of men considered as such,
and without any form of trial causes them to be beaten
with rods in his presence.</p>

<p>In order to give an idea of the manner in which such
an affair is conducted, I will describe an instance of the
kind which happened in Orel, which was approved by
the higher authorities. Like the landowner in Tula,
the landed proprietor at Orel chose to take possession
of the peasants' property, and here, too, as in the former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
instance, the peasants resisted. In this case, the landowner,
without the consent of the peasants, wished to
dam up, for the benefit of his mill, a flow of water which
supplied the meadows. The peasants resisted this.</p>

<p>The landlord lodged a complaint with the rural commissary,
who illegally (as was afterward admitted by
the court) decided the case in favor of the landowner,
giving him leave to divert the water. The landowner
sent workmen to close the channel through which the
water descended. The peasants, excited at this unfair
judgment, sent their women to prevent the landowner's
men from damming the channel. The women proceeded
to the dam, upset the carts, and drove the workmen
away. The landowner entered a complaint against
them for committing a lawless act. The rural commissary
gave the order to arrest and lock up in the village
jail one woman out of every family,&mdash;an order rather
difficult to execute, since each family included several
women; and as it was impossible to tell which of them
to arrest, the police could not fulfil the order. The landowner
complained to the Governor of the laxity of the
police. The Governor, without stopping to consider the
case, gave strict orders to the <em>Ispravnik</em> to carry out
at once the orders of the rural commissary. In obedience
to his superior the <em>Ispravnik</em> arrived in the village,
and with that contempt for the individual peculiar to
Russian authorities, ordered the police to seize the first
women they could. Disputes and resistance arose. The
<em>Ispravnik</em>, paying no attention to this, persisted in his
order that the police should take one woman, innocent
or guilty, from every household, and put her under arrest.
The peasants defended their wives and mothers; they
refused to give them up, and resisted the police and the
<em>Ispravnik</em>. Thus another and a greater offense was
committed,&mdash;resistance to authority,&mdash;which was at
once reported in town. Then the Governor, just as I
saw the Governor of Tula, with a battalion of soldiers
supplied with rods and muskets, backed by all due accessories
of telegraph and telephone, accompanied by a
learned physician who was to superintend the flogging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
from a medical standpoint, started on an express train
for the spot, like the modern Genghis Khan predicted by
Herzen. In the <em>Volostnoye Pravlenie</em><a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> were the soldiers,
a detachment of police with their revolvers suspended
on red cords, the principal peasants of the neighborhood,
and the men accused. Around them had collected
a crowd of perhaps a thousand.</p>

<p>Driving up to the house of the <em>Volostnoye Pravlenie</em>,
the Governor alighted from his carriage and delivered
an address, which had been prepared in advance, after
which he inquired for the criminals, and ordered a bench
to be brought. No one understood what he meant until
the policeman, who always accompanied the Governor
and made all the arrangements for the punishments
which had already been enforced several times in the
government of Orel, explained that the bench was to be
used for flogging. This bench and the rods that had
been brought by the party were both produced. The
executioners had been previously selected from certain
horse-thieves taken from the same village, the military
having refused to do the business.</p>

<p>When all was ready the Governor bade the first of
the twelve men who were pointed out to him by the
landowner as the ringleaders to step forward. It so
happened that he was the father of a family, a man
forty-five years of age, respected in the community,
whose rights he had manfully defended.</p>

<p>He was led to the bench, stripped, and ordered to lie
down.</p>

<p>He would have begged for mercy, but realizing how
little it would avail, he made the sign of the cross and
stretched himself out on the bench. Two policemen
held him down, and the learned doctor stood by, ready
in case of need to give his scientific assistance. The
executioners having spat upon their hands, swung the
rods, and the flogging began. The bench, it seemed,
was too narrow, and it was found difficult to keep the
writhing victim, whose muscles twitched convulsively,
from falling off. Then the Governor ordered to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
brought another bench, to which a plank was adjusted
in such a way as to support it. The soldiers, ever ready
with their continual salutes and responses of "Yes,
your Excellency," swiftly and obediently executed the
orders, while in the meantime the half-naked, pale, and
suffering man, trembling, with contracted brows and
downcast eyes, stood by waiting. When the bench was
readjusted, he was again stretched out upon it, and the
horse-stealers renewed their blows. His back, his legs,
and even his sides were covered with bleeding wounds,
and every blow was followed by the muffled groan which
he could no longer repress. In the crowd that stood
by one could hear the sobs of the wife and mother, the
children, and the kinsfolk of the man, as well as of all
who had been called to witness the punishment.</p>

<p>The wretched Governor, intoxicated with power, who
had no doubt convinced himself of the necessity for this
performance, counted the strokes on his fingers, while
he smoked cigarette after cigarette, for the lighting of
which several obliging persons hastened to offer him a
burning match.</p>

<p>After fifty blows had been given, the peasant lay
motionless, without uttering a sound, and the doctor,
who had been educated in a government school that he
might devote his scientific knowledge to the service of
his country and his sovereign, approached the tortured
man, felt his pulse, listened to the beating of his heart,
and reported to the representative of authority that the
victim had become unconscious, and declared that, from
a scientific point of view, it might prove dangerous to
prolong the punishment. But the unfortunate Governor,
utterly intoxicated by the sight of blood, ordered the
flogging to go on until seventy strokes had been given,
the number which he for some reason deemed necessary.
After the seventieth blow the Governor said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That will do! Now bring on the next one!"</p>

<p>They raised the mutilated and unconscious man, with
his swollen back, and carried him away, and the next
was brought forward. The sobs and groans of the
crowd increased, but the tortures were continued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>So it went on until each of the twelve men had received
seventy strokes. They begged for mercy, they
groaned and screamed. The sobs and moans of the
women grew louder and more heartrending, and the
faces of the men of the crowd more gloomy. But there
stood the troops, and the torture did not cease until it
had seemed sufficient to the unfortunate, half-intoxicated,
erring man called the Governor.</p>

<p>Not only did the magistrates, the officers, and the
soldiers sanction this act by their presence, but they
took part in it, preventing the crowd from interfering
with the order of its execution.</p>

<p>When I asked one of the chief officials why these
tortures were inflicted after the men had already submitted,
he replied, with the significant air of a man who
understands all the fine points of political wisdom, that
it was done because it had been proved by experience
that if the peasants are not punished they will soon
begin again to oppose the decrees of authority, and that
the punishment of a few strengthens forever the power
of authority.</p>

<p>And now I saw the Governor of Tula, with his clerks,
officers, and soldiers, on his way to perform a similar
act. Once more by murder or torture the sentence of
the higher authorities was to be carried out,&mdash;a sentence
whose object was to enable a young landowner, the possessor
of a yearly income of 100,000 roubles, to receive
3000 more for a tract of wood of which he had basely
defrauded a whole community of needy and starving
peasants, the price of which he would squander in a few
weeks in the restaurants of St. Petersburg, Moscow, and
Paris. Such was the errand of the men I met.</p>

<p>It would seem as if there must be some purpose in this
encounter, when, after two years of incessant contemplation,
of continuous thought in one direction, fate should,
for the first time in my life, bring me face to face with
this phenomenon, a living illustration of the theory I
have so long cherished; namely, that the entire organization
of our life rests, not on any principle of justice,
as men who occupy and enjoy advantageous positions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
under the existing system like to imagine, but on the
rudest and most barefaced violence, on the murder and
torture of human beings.</p>

<p>Those who possess large estates and large capital,
or who receive high salaries collected from the needy
working-classes, from the people who often lack the
necessaries of life; merchants, clerks, doctors, lawyers,
artists, scientists, writers, coachmen, cooks, and valets,
who earn their living in the service of rich men,&mdash;fondly
believe that the privileges which they enjoy are not the
outcome of violence, but the natural result of a voluntary
interchange of services; that these privileges are by no
means the result of the outrages and floggings endured
by their fellow-men, such as took place last summer, in
Russia, in Orel and elsewhere, as the like took place in
many parts of Europe and America. They prefer to
believe that the privileges they enjoy are the spontaneous
result of a mutual agreement among men; that violence is
only the natural result of certain universal and superior
laws, judicial, political, or economic. They try not to see
that the privileges they possess are only held by them in
consequence of some circumstance, not unlike that which
compelled the peasants, who had tended the growing forest
and greatly needed it, to surrender it to the rich landowner,
who had taken no pains to preserve it, and who did not
require it for his own use; men who will either be flogged
or murdered if they refuse to surrender it. Now, if it is
an undeniable fact that the mill in Orel was made to
yield an increased income to the proprietor, and that the
forest raised by the peasants was given to the landowner
only because of the flogging and the executions either
threatened or actually suffered, then it must be equally
evident that all the other exclusive rights of the rich,
which deprive the poor of the bare necessaries of life,
rest on the same basis.</p>

<p>If the peasants who need land in order to support their
families may not cultivate the land around them, and if land
sufficient to feed a thousand families is in the hands of one
man, a Russian, an Englishman, an Austrian, a rich landowner
of whatever nationality; and if the merchant who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
buys grain from the needy grower keeps it in his warehouses
in the midst of a destitute and famishing population,
or sells it for three times its value to those of
whom he bought it at the lowest price,&mdash;it evidently
springs from the same cause.</p>

<p>And if, beyond a certain line called the frontier, one
man is not allowed to purchase certain goods without
paying duties to other men who have nothing to do with
their production, and if a man is obliged to part with his
last cow in order to pay taxes which are distributed by
the government among its officials, or used for the support
of soldiers who may kill the taxpayers, it would
seem evident that all this is not the result of certain
abstract rights, but of incidents like those which may
even now be going on in the government of Tula, which
in one form or another occur periodically all the world
over, wherever state organization exists, and wherever
there are rich and poor.</p>

<p>Owing to the fact that outrage and murder do not
accompany all social relations founded on violence,
those who possess the exclusive privileges of the governing
classes assure themselves and others that the advantages
which they enjoy are not the result of violence
and bloodshed, but derived from certain vague and abstract
rights. Still it ought to be evident that if those
men, who realize the injustice of it all (as is the case with
the working-classes at the present day), continue to surrender
the greater part of their earnings to the capitalist
and the landowner, and if they pay taxes, knowing that
such taxes are not put to a good use, they do this, not
because they acknowledge the justice of certain abstract
rights, whose meaning is unknown to them, but only
because they know that they will be whipped and put
to death if they refuse to comply.</p>

<p>If it is not always necessary to imprison men, to flog
them, or to put them to death when the landowner collects
his rents, if the needy peasant pays a treble price to the
merchant who deceives him, or the mechanic accepts
wages absurdly small in comparison with the income of
his master, or the poor man parts with his last rouble for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
duties and taxes, it is because he remembers that men
have been flogged and put to death for trying to avoid
compliance with what was demanded of them. Like a
caged tiger, who does not touch the meat that lies before
his eyes, and who when he is ordered to leap over a stick
obeys at once, not because he likes it, but because he has
not forgotten past hunger or the red-hot iron which he
felt every time he refused to obey; so it is with men,
who, when they submit to a law which is not for their
advantage, to a law which is disastrous to their interests,
or to one which they firmly believe to be unjust, do so
because they remember what they will have to suffer if
they refuse to comply.</p>

<p>Those who benefit by privileges born of violence
long since perpetrated, often forget, and are very glad to
forget, how such privileges were obtained. And yet one
has but to recall the annals of history,&mdash;not the history
of the exploits of kings, but genuine history,&mdash;the history
of the oppression of the majority by the minority, in
order to acknowledge that the scourge, the prison, and
the gallows have been the original and only sources
whence all the advantages of the rich over the poor have
sprung. One has but to remember the persistent and
undying passion for gain among men, the mainspring of
human action in these days, to become convinced that
the advantages of the rich over the poor can be maintained
in no other way.</p>

<p>At rare intervals, oppression, flogging, imprisonment,
executions, the direct object of which is not to promote
the welfare of the rich, may possibly occur, but we can
positively declare that in our community, where for every
man who lives at ease there are ten overworked, hungry,
and often cruelly suffering families of working-men, all
the privileges of the rich, all their luxury, all their superfluities,
are acquired and maintained only by tortures,
imprisonments, and executions.</p>

<p>The train that I met on the 9th day of September
carrying soldiers, muskets, ammunition, and rods to the
famine-stricken peasants, in order that the wealthy
landowner might possess in peace the tract of wood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
he had wrested from the peasants, a necessity of life to
them, to him a mere superfluity, affords a vivid proof of
the degree to which men have unconsciously acquired
the habit of committing acts wholly at variance with
their convictions and their conscience.</p>

<p>The express consisted of one first-class carriage for
the Governor, officials, and officers, and several vans
crowded with soldiers. The jaunty young fellows in
their fresh new uniforms were crowded together, either
standing, or sitting with their legs dangling outside the
wide open sliding doors of the vans. Some were smoking,
laughing, and jesting, some cracking seeds and
spitting out the shells. A few who jumped down
upon the platform to get a drink of water from the
tub, meeting some of the officers, slackened their pace
and made that senseless gesture of lifting one hand to
the forehead; then, with serious faces, as though they
had been doing something not only sensible but actually
important, they passed by, watching the officers as they
went. Soon they broke into a run, evidently in high
spirits, stamping on the planks of the platform as they
ran, and chatting, as is but natural for good-natured,
healthy young fellows who are making a journey together.
These men, who were on their way to murder
starving fathers and grandfathers, seemed as unconcerned
as though they were off on the pleasantest, or at
least the most everyday, business in the world.</p>

<p>The gaily dressed officers and officials who were scattered
about on the platform and in the first-class waiting-room
produced the same impression. At a table
laden with bottles sat the Governor, the commander of
the expedition, attired in his semi-military uniform, eating
his luncheon and quietly discussing the weather with
some friends he had met, as though the business that
called him hither was so simple a matter that it could
neither ruffle his equanimity nor diminish his interest in
the change of the weather.</p>

<p>At some distance, but tasting no food, sat the chief of
the police with a mournful countenance, seemingly oppressed
with the tiresome formalities. Officers in gaudy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
gold-embroidered uniforms moved to and fro, talking
loudly; one group was seated at a table just finishing
a bottle of wine; an officer at the bar who had eaten a
cake brushed away the crumbs that had fallen on his
uniform, and with a self-sufficient air flung a coin upon
the counter; some walked nonchalantly up and down in
front of our train looking at the faces of the women.</p>

<p>All these men on their way to commit murder, or to
torture the starved and defenseless peasants, by whose
toil they were supported, looked as if engaged upon
some important business which they were really proud
to execute.</p>

<p>What did it mean?</p>

<p>These men, who were within half an hour's ride of the
spot where, in order to procure for a rich man an extra
3000 roubles, of which he had no need whatever, which
he was unjustly confiscating from a community of famished
peasants, might be obliged to perform the most
shocking deeds that the imagination can conceive,&mdash;to
murder and torture, as they did in Orel, innocent men,
their brothers. These men were now calmly approaching
the time and place when these horrors were to
begin.</p>

<p>Since the preparations had been made, it could not
very well be claimed that all these men, officers and
privates, did not know what was before them, and what
they were expected to do. The Governor had given
orders for the rods, the officials had purchased the birch
twigs, bargained for them, and noted the purchase in
their accounts. In the military department orders had
been given and received concerning ball cartridges.
They all knew that they were on their way to torture
and possibly to put to death their brothers exhausted by
famine, and that perhaps in an hour they might begin
the work.</p>

<p>To say, as they themselves would say, that they are
acting from principle, from a conviction that the state
system must be maintained, is untrue. Those men, in
the first place, have rarely, if ever, bestowed a single
thought upon political science; and in the second place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
because they could never be convinced that the business
on which they are engaged serves to support
rather than destroy the State; and finally, because, as
a matter of fact, the majority of these men, if not all of
them, would not only be unwilling to sacrifice their
peace and comfort to maintain the State, but would
never miss the opportunity to promote their own interests
at the expense of the State,&mdash;therefore it is not
for the sake of so vague a principle as that of maintaining
the State that they do this.</p>

<p>What, then, does all this mean?</p>

<p>I know these men. I may not know them as individuals,
it is true, yet I know their dispositions, their
past lives, their modes of thought. They have had
mothers, some have wives and children. Actually, they
are, for the most part, kindly, gentle, tender-hearted
men, who abhor any kind of cruelty, to say nothing of
killing or torturing; moreover, every one of them professes
Christianity, and considers violence perpetrated
against the defenseless a contemptible and shameful
act. Each taken individually, in everyday life, is not
only incapable, for the sake of personal advantage, of
doing one-hundredth part of what was done by the
Governor at Orel, but any one of them would consider
himself insulted if it were suggested that he could be
capable of doing anything like it in private life. And
yet they are within a half-hour's ride of the spot where
they will inevitably find themselves compelled to do such
deeds.</p>

<p>What can it mean, then?</p>

<p>It is not only the men on this train who are ready to
commit murder and violence, but those others with whom
the affair originated, the landowner, the steward, the
judge, those in St. Petersburg who issue orders,&mdash;the
Minister of State, the Czar, also worthy men and professors
of Christianity,&mdash;how can they, knowing the
consequences, conceive such a scheme, and direct its
execution?</p>

<p>How can they, even, who take no active part in it,&mdash;the
spectators, whose indignation would be aroused by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
accounts of private violence, even though it be but the
ill-usage of a horse,&mdash;how can they allow this shocking
business to go on without rising in wrath to resist it,
crying aloud, "No, we will not allow you to flog or to
kill starving men because they refuse to surrender their
last property villainously attempted to be wrested from
them!" And not only are men found willing to do
these deeds, but most of them, even the chief instigators,
like the steward, the landowner, the judge, and those
who take part in originating prosecution and punishment,
the Governor, the Minister of State, the Czar,
remain perfectly calm, and show no sign of remorse over
such things. And they who are about to execute this
crime are equally calm.</p>

<p>Even the spectators, who, it would seem, have no personal
interest in the matter, look upon these men who
are about to take part in this dastardly business with
sympathy rather than with aversion or condemnation.</p>

<p>In the same compartment with me sat a merchant
who dealt in timber, a peasant by birth, who in loud and
decided tones expressed his approval of the outrage
which the peasants were about to suffer. "The government
must be obeyed; that's what it's for. If we
pepper them well, they will never rebel again. It's no
more than they deserve!" he said.</p>

<p>What did it all mean?</p>

<p>It could not be said that all these men, the instigators,
the participants, the accomplices in this business, were
rascals, who, in defiance of conscience, realizing the utter
abomination of the act, were, either from mercenary motives
or from fear of punishment, determined to commit
it. Any man of them would, given the requisite circumstances,
stand up for his convictions. Not one of those
officials would steal a purse, or read another man's letter,
or endure an insult without demanding satisfaction from
the offender. Not one of those officers would cheat at
cards, or neglect to pay a gambling debt, or betray a
companion, or flee from the battlefield, or abandon a flag.
Not one of those soldiers would dare to reject the sacrament,
or even taste meat on Good Friday. Each of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
these men would choose to endure any kind of privation,
suffering, or danger, rather than consent to do a deed
which he considered wrong. Hence it is evident that
they are able to resist whatever is contrary to their
convictions.</p>

<p>Still less true would it be to pronounce these men
brutes, to whom such deeds are congenial rather than
repulsive. One needs but to talk with them to become
convinced that all,&mdash;landowner, judge, minister, governor,
Czar, officers, and soldiers,&mdash;at the bottom of
their hearts not only disapprove of such deeds, but when
a sense of their true significance is borne in upon them,
really suffer at being forced to take part in these scenes.
They can only try not to think of them.</p>

<p>One needs but to speak to those who are actors in this
business, beginning with the landowner and ending with
the lowest policeman or soldier, to discover that at the
bottom of their hearts they all acknowledge the wickedness
of the deed, and know that it would be better to
abstain from it; and this knowledge makes them suffer.</p>

<p>A lady of liberal views in our train, seeing the Governor
and the officers in the first-class waiting-room, and
learning the object of their journey, began to talk in an
ostensibly loud tone, in order that they might hear what
she said, condemning the present laws and crying shame
upon the men who took part in this business. This made
everybody feel uncomfortable. The men knew not
where to look, yet no one ventured to argue the point.
The passengers pretended that remarks so senseless
deserved no reply, but it was evident by the expression
of their faces and their wandering eyes that they felt
ashamed. I noticed the same in regard to the soldiers.
They knew well enough that they were going about an
evil business, and they preferred not to think of what
was before them. When the timber merchant, insincerely,
in my opinion, and simply by way of showing his
superior knowledge, began to speak of the necessity of
these measures, the soldiers who heard him turned away
frowning, and pretended not to listen to him.</p>

<p>The landowner, his steward, the minister, the Czar, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
who are parties to this business, those who were traveling
by this train, even those who, taking no part in the
affair, were but lookers-on, all really know it to be
wicked. Why, then, do they do these things, why do
they repeat them, why do they permit them to be?</p>

<p>Ask the landowner who started the affair; the judge
who rendered a decision legal in form, but absolutely unjust;
and those who, like the soldiers and the peasants,
will, with their own hands, execute this work of beating
and murdering their brothers,&mdash;all of them, instigators,
administrators, and executioners, will make essentially
the same reply.</p>

<p>The officials will say that the present system requires
to be supported in this manner, and it is for this reason
that they do these things, because the good of the country,
the welfare of mankind in general, of social life and
civilization, demand it.</p>

<p>The soldiers, men of the lower classes, who are forced
to execute this violence with their own hands, will answer
that the higher authorities, who are supposed to
know their business, have commanded it, and that it is
for them to obey. It never occurs to them to question
the capacity of those who represent the higher authorities.
If the possibility of error is ever admitted, it is
only in the case of some subordinate authority; the
higher power whence all things emanate is supposed to
be absolutely infallible.</p>

<p>Thus, while attributing their actions to various motives,
both principals and subordinates agree that the existing
order is the one best suited to the present time, and that
it is the sacred duty of every man to maintain it.</p>

<p>This assurance of the necessity and immutability of
the existing order is continually advanced by all participators
in violence committed by the State, and that, as
the existing order never can be changed, the refusal of
a single individual to perform the duties imposed on him
will make no difference as far as the fundamental principle
is concerned, and will only result in the substitution
of another who may be more cruel and do more harm.</p>

<p>This belief that the existing order is immutable, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
that it is the sacred duty of every man to lend it support,
encourages every man of good moral character to take
part, with a conscience more or less clear, in such affairs
as that which occurred in Orel, and the one in which
those in the train for Tula were going to take part.</p>

<p>On what, then, is this belief founded?</p>

<p>It is but natural that it should seem pleasant and desirable
to a landowner to believe that the existing order
is indispensable and immutable, because it secures to
him the income from his hundreds and thousands of
<i lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">dessiatins</i> by which his idle and luxurious existence is
maintained.</p>

<p>It is also natural that the judge should willingly admit
the necessity of a system through which he receives fifty
times more than the most hard-working laboring man.
And the same may be said in regard to the other higher
functionaries. It is only while the present system endures
that he, as governor, procureur, senator, or member
of the council, can receive his salary of several thousands,
without which he and his family would certainly
perish; for outside the place which he fills, more or
less well according to his abilities and diligence, he
could command only a fraction of what he receives. The
ministers, the head of the State, and every person in
high authority are all alike in this, save that the higher
their rank, the more exclusive their position, the more
important it becomes that they should believe no order
possible, except that which now exists; for were it overthrown,
not only would they find it impossible to gain
similar positions, but they would fall lower in the scale
than other men. The man who voluntarily hires himself
out as a policeman for ten roubles a month, a sum which
he could easily earn in any other position, has but little
interest in the preservation of the existing system, and
therefore may or may not believe in its immutability.</p>

<p>But the king or emperor, who receives his millions,
who knows that around him there are thousands of men
envious to take his place, who knows that from no other
quarter could he draw such an income or receive such
homage, that, if overthrown, he might be judged for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
abuse of power,&mdash;there is neither king nor emperor who
can help believing in the immutability and sanctity of
the existing order. The higher the position in which a
man is placed, the more unstable it is; and the more
perilous and frightful the possible downfall, the more
firmly will he believe in the immutability of the existing
order; and he is able to do wicked and cruel deeds with
a perfectly peaceful conscience, because he persuades
himself that they are done, not for his own benefit, but
for the support of the existing order.</p>

<p>And so it is with every individual in authority, from
obscure policemen to the man who occupies the most
exalted rank,&mdash;the positions they occupy being more
advantageous than those which they might be capable
of filling if the present system did not exist. All these
men believe more or less in its immutability, because it is
advantageous to them.</p>

<p>But what influences the peasants, the soldiers, who
stand on the lowest rung of the ladder and who derive
no advantage from the existing system, who are in the
most enslaved and degraded condition; what induces
them to believe that the existing order, which serves to
keep them in this inferior position, is the best, and one
which should be maintained; and why are they willing,
in order to promote this end, to violate their consciences
by committing wicked deeds?</p>

<p>What urges them to the false conclusion that the existing
order is immutable and ought therefore to be maintained,
when the fact is that its immutability is due only
to their own effort to maintain it?</p>

<p>Why do those men, taken from the plow, whom we
see masquerading in ugly, objectionable uniforms, with
blue collars and gold buttons, go about armed with
muskets and sabers to kill their famishing fathers and
brothers? They derive no advantage from their present
position; they would be no losers were they deprived
of it, since it is worse than the one from which they were
taken.</p>

<p>Those in authority belonging to the higher classes,
the landowners and merchants, the judges, senators,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
governors, ministers, and kings, the officials in general,
participate in such actions and maintain the present system,
because such a system is for their interest. Often
enough they are kind-hearted and gentle men. They
play no personal part in these acts; all they do is to institute
inquiries, pronounce judgments, and issue commands.
Those in authority do not themselves execute
the deeds which they have devised and ordered. They
but rarely see in what manner these dreadful deeds are
executed. But the unfortunate members of the lower
classes, who receive no benefit from the existing system,
who, on the other hand, find themselves greatly despised
because of the duties which they perform in order that
a system which is opposed to their own interests may be
maintained,&mdash;they who tear men from the bosom of
their families to send them to the galleys, who bind and
imprison them, who stand on guard over them, who
shoot them, why do they do this? What is it that compels
these men to believe that the existing order is
immutable, and that it is their duty to maintain it?
Violence exists only because there are those who with
their own hands maltreat, bind, imprison, and murder.
If there were no policemen, or soldiers, or armed men of
any sort ready when bidden to use violence and to put
men to death, not one of those who sign death-warrants,
or sentence for imprisonment for life or hard
labor in the galleys, would ever have sufficient courage
himself to hang, imprison, or torture one thousandth
part of those whom now, sitting in their studies, these
men calmly order to be hung or tortured, because they
do not see it done, they do not do it themselves. Their
servants do it for them in some far-away corner.</p>

<p>All these deeds of injustice and cruelty have become
an integral part of the existing system of life, only because
there are men ever ready to execute them. If there
were no such men, the multitude of human beings who
are now the victims of violence would be spared, and
furthermore, the magistrates would never dare to issue,
nor even dream of issuing, those commands which they
now send forth with such assurance. If there were no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
men to obey the will of others and to execute commands to
torture and murder, no one would ever dare to defend the
declaration so confidently made by landowners and men
of leisure; namely, that the land lying on all sides of
the unfortunate peasants, who are perishing for the want
of it, is the property of the man who does not till it,
and that reserves of grain, fraudulently obtained, are to
be held intact amidst a famine-stricken and dying population,
because the merchant must have his profit. If
there were no men ready at the bidding of the authorities
to torture and murder, the landowner would never dream
of seizing a forest which had been tended by the peasants;
nor would officials consider themselves entitled to
salaries paid to them from money wrung from the famished
people whom they oppress, or which they derive
for the prosecution, imprisonment, and exile of men who
denounce falsehood and preach the truth.</p>

<p>All this is done because those in authority well know
that they have always at hand submissive agents ready
to obey their commands to outrage and to murder.</p>

<p>It is to this crowd of submissive slaves, ready to obey all
orders, that we owe the deeds of the whole series of tyrants,
from Napoleon to the obscure captain who bids his men
fire upon the people. It is through the agency of policemen
and soldiers (especially the latter, since the former
can act only when supported by military force) that these
deeds of violence are committed. What, then, has induced
those who are by no means benefited by doing with their
hands these dreadful deeds,&mdash;what is it that has led
these kindly men into an error so gross that they actually
believe that the present system, which is so distressing,
so baleful, so fatal, is the one best suited to the
times? Who has led them into this extraordinary
aberration?</p>

<p>They can never have persuaded themselves that a course
which is not only painful and opposed to their interests,
but which is fatal to their class, which forms nine-tenths
of the entire population, one which, too, is opposed to
their conscience, is right. "What reason can you give
for killing men, when God's commandment says, 'Thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
shalt not kill'?" is a question I have often put to different
soldiers. And it always embarrassed them to have a
question put which recalled what they would rather not
remember.</p>

<p>They knew that the divine law forbade murder,&mdash;<em>thou
shalt not kill</em>,&mdash;and they had always known of this compulsory
military duty, but had never thought of one as
contradictory to the other. The hesitating replies to my
question were usually to the effect that the act of killing
a man in war and the execution of criminals by order
of the government were not included in the general prohibition
against murder. But when I rejoined that no
such limitation existed in the law of God, and cited the
Christian doctrine of brotherhood, the forgiveness of injuries,
the injunction to love one's neighbor, all of which
precepts are quite contrary to murder, the men of the
lower class would usually agree with me and ask, "How
then can it be that the government (which they believe
cannot err) sends troops to war and orders the execution
of criminals?" When I replied that this was a mistake
on the part of the government, my interlocutors became
still more uncomfortable, and either dropped the conversation
or showed annoyance.</p>

<p>"Probably there is a law for it. I should think the
bishops know more than you do," a Russian soldier once
said to me. And he evidently felt relieved, confident
that his superiors had found a law, one that had authorized
his ancestors and their successors, millions of men
like himself, to serve the State, and that the question I
had asked is in the nature of a conundrum.</p>

<p>Every man in Christendom has undoubtedly been
taught by tradition, by revelation, and by the voice of
conscience, which can never be gainsaid, that murder
is one of the most heinous crimes men can commit; it
is thus affirmed in the gospel, and they know that this
sin of murder is not altered by conditions&mdash;that is to
say, if it is sinful to kill one man, it is sinful to kill another.
Any man knows that, if murder be a sin, it is
not changed by the character or position of the man
against whom it is committed, which is the case also with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
adultery, theft, and all other sins, and yet men are accustomed
from childhood to see murder, not only acknowledged,
but blessed by those whom they are taught to
regard as their spiritual directors appointed by Christ, and
to know that their temporal leaders, with calm assurance,
countenance the custom of murder, and summon all men,
in the name of the law and even the name of God, to its
participation. Men perceive the existence of an inconsistency,
but finding themselves unable to discern its
cause, they naturally attribute the idea to their own
ignorance. The obviousness and crudity of the contradiction
confirms them in this belief. They cannot imagine
that their superiors and teachers, even the scientists,
could advocate with so much assurance two principles
so utterly at variance as the command to follow the law
of Christ, and the requirement to commit murder. No
pure-minded, innocent child, no youth, could imagine that
men who stand so high in his esteem, whom he looks
upon with such reverence, could for any purpose deceive
him so unscrupulously.</p>

<p>And yet it is this very deception which is constantly
practised. In the first place, to all working-men, who
have personally no time to analyze moral and religious
problems, it is taught from childhood, by example and
precept, that tortures and murders are compatible with
Christianity, and in certain cases they should not only
be permitted, but must be employed; in the second place,
to certain among them, engaged in the army either
through conscription or voluntarily, it is conveyed that
the accomplishment with their own hands of torture or
homicide is not only their sacred duty, but a glorious
exploit, meriting praise and recompense.</p>

<p>This universal deception is propagated by all catechisms
or their substitutes, those books which at the
present time teachers are compelled to use in the instruction
of the young. It is taught that violence,&mdash;outrage,
imprisonment, execution,&mdash;the murder that
takes place in civil or in foreign war, has for its object the
maintenance and security of the political organization,&mdash;whether
this be an absolute or a constitutional monarchy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
consulate, republic, or commune,&mdash;that it is perfectly
legitimate, and that it is in contradiction neither
to morality nor Christianity.</p>

<p>And men are so firmly convinced of this that they
grow up, live, and die in the belief, never for a moment
doubting it.</p>

<p>So much for this universal deception. And now for
another, which is special, and practised upon soldiers
and police, the instruments by whose agency outrages
and murders, necessary for the support and maintenance
of the existing order, are accomplished.</p>

<p>The military rules and regulations of every country
are practically the same as those formulated in the
Russian military code.</p>

<p>"87. To fulfil exactly, and without comment, the
orders of the superior officers, means&mdash;to execute
orders with precision, without considering whether they
are good or bad, or whether their execution be possible.
Only the superior is responsible for the consequences of
his order.</p>

<p>"88. The only occasion on which the inferior should
not obey the order of his superior is when he sees
plainly that in obeying it ..." (Here one naturally thinks
it will surely go on to say when he plainly sees that
in fulfilling the order of his superior he violates the
law of God. Not at all; it goes on to say:) "<em>sees plainly
that he violates the oath of allegiance and duty to his
sovereign</em>."</p>

<p>It is stated in the code that a man, in becoming a
soldier, can and must execute <em>all</em> the orders, without
exception, which he receives from his superior; orders
which, for a soldier, are for the most part connected
with murder. He may violate every law, human and
divine, as long as he does not violate his oath of allegiance
to him who, at a given time, happens to be in
power.</p>

<p>Thus it stands in the Russian military code, and this
is the substance of the military codes of other nations.
It could not be otherwise. The foundations of the
power of the State rest upon the delusion by means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
which men are set free from their obligations to God
and to their own consciences, and bound to obey the
will of a casual superior.</p>

<p>This is the basis of the appalling conviction that prevails
among the lower classes, that the existing system,
so ruinous to them, is necessary and justifiable, and that
it must be maintained by outrage and murder.</p>

<p>This is inevitable. In order to force the lower, the
more numerous classes to act as their own oppressors
and tormentors, to commit deeds contrary to their consciences,
it is necessary to deceive them.</p>

<p>And this is done.</p>

<p>Not long since I saw again put into practice this
shameful deception, and again wondered to see it effected
without opposition and so audaciously.</p>

<p>In the beginning of November, on my way through
Tula, I saw at the gates of the <i lang="sl" xml:lang="sl">Zemskaya Uprava</i> the
familiar dense crowd of men and women, from which
issued the sounds of drunken voices, blended with the
heartrending sobs of the wives and mothers.</p>

<p>The military conscription was in progress.</p>

<p>As usual, I could not pass by without pausing; the
sight attracts me as by fascination.</p>

<p>Again I mingled with the crowd, and stood looking
on, questioning, and marveling at the facility with which
this most terrible of all offenses is committed in broad
daylight, and in the midst of a large city.</p>

<p>On the first day of November, in every village in
Russia, with its population of one hundred millions, the
<i lang="sl" xml:lang="sl">starostas</i>,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> according to custom, take the men whose
names are entered on the rolls, frequently their own
sons, and carry them to town.</p>

<p>On the way the men drink freely, unchecked by the
elder men; they realize that entering upon this insane
business of leaving their wives and mothers, giving up
everything that is sacred to them, only to become the
senseless tools of murder, is too painful if one's senses
are not stupefied with wine.</p>

<p>And thus they journey on, carousing, brawling, singing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
and fighting. The night is spent in a tavern, and
on this morning, having drunk still more, they assemble
before the house of the <i lang="sl" xml:lang="sl">Uprava</i>.</p>

<p>Some in new sheepskin coats, with knit mufflers
wound round their necks, some with their eyes swollen
with drinking, some noisy and boisterous, by way of
stimulating their courage, others silent and woebegone,
they were gathered near the gates, surrounded by their
wives and mothers with tear-stained faces, awaiting
their turn (I happened to be there on the day when the
recruits were received, that is to say, the day on which
they were examined), while others were crowding the
entry of the office.</p>

<p>Meanwhile they are hurrying on the work within. A
door opens and the guard calls for Piotr Sidorov. Piotr
Sidorov makes the sign of the cross, looks around with
a startled gaze, and opening a glass door, he enters the
small room where the recruits take off their clothes. The
man before him, his friend, who has just been enrolled,
has but this moment stepped out of the office stark
naked, and with chattering teeth hastens to put on his
clothes. Piotr Sidorov has heard, and can plainly see
by the look on his face, that the man has been enlisted.
He longs to question him, but he is ordered to undress
as quickly as possible. He pulls off his sheepskin coat,
drops his waistcoat and his shirt, and with prominent
ribs, trembling and reeking with the odors of liquor,
tobacco, and sweat, steps barefooted into the office,
wondering what he shall do with his large sinewy hands.</p>

<p>A portrait of the Emperor in uniform, with a ribbon
across his breast, in a large golden frame, hangs in a
conspicuous place, while a small ikon of Christ, clad in
a loose garment, with the crown of thorns on his head,
hangs in one corner. In the middle of the room is a
table covered with a green cloth on which papers are
lying, and on which stands a small three-cornered object
surmounted by an eagle and called the mirror of
justice. Around the table the officials sit tranquilly.
One smokes, another turns over the papers. As soon
as Sidorov enters a guard comes up and measures him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
His chin is raised and his feet are adjusted. Then a
man who is smoking a cigarette&mdash;the doctor&mdash;approaches
him, and without glancing at his face, but
gazing in another direction, touches his body with an
expression of disgust, measures him, orders the guard
to open his mouth, tells him to breathe, and then proceeds
to dictate to another man who takes down the
minutes. Finally, and still without even one glance at
his face, the doctor says: "He will do! The next!"
and with a wearied air he seats himself at the table.
Once more the guard hustles him about, bidding him to
make haste. Somehow or other he pulls on his shirt,
fumbling for the sleeves, hastily gets on his trousers,
wraps his feet in the rags he uses for stockings, pulls
on his boots, hunts for his muffler and cap, tucks his
sheepskin coat under his arm, and is escorted to that
part of the hall which is fenced off by a bench, where
the recruits who have been admitted are placed. A
young countryman like himself, but from another, far-away
government, who is a soldier already, with a
musket to which a bayonet is attached, guards him,
ready to run him through the body if he should attempt
to escape.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the crowd of fathers, mothers, and wives,
hustled by policemen, presses around the gates, trying
to find out who has been taken and who rejected. A
man who has been rejected comes out and tells them
that Piotr has been admitted; then is heard the cry of
Piotr's young wife, for whom this word means a four or
five years' separation, and the dissolute life such as a
soldier's wife in domestic service is.</p>

<p>But here comes a man with flowing hair and dressed
differently from the others, who has just arrived; he
descends from his droschky and goes toward the house
of the <i lang="sl" xml:lang="sl">Zemskaya Uprava</i>, while the policemen clear a
way for him through the crowd.</p>

<p>"The Father has arrived to swear them in." And
this "Father," who has always been accustomed to
believe himself a special and privileged servant of
Christ, and who is usually quite unconscious of his false<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
position, enters the room where the recruits who have
been admitted are waiting for him; he puts on, as a
vestment, a sort of brocade curtain, disengages from
it his flowing hair, opens the Bible wherein an oath is
forbidden, lifts the cross, that cross on which Christ
was crucified for refusing to do what this person, his
supposed servant, commands men to do, and all these
defenseless and deluded young men repeat after him
the lie so familiar to his lips, which he utters with such
assurance. He reads while they repeat: "I promise
and swear to the Lord Almighty, upon His holy Bible,"
etc. ... to defend (that is, to murder all those whom I
shall be ordered to murder) and to do whatever those
men, strangers to me, who regard me only as a necessary
tool to be used in perpetrating the outrages by
which they oppress my brethren and preserve their
own positions, command me to do. All the recruits having
stupidly repeated the words, the so-called Father
departs, quite sure that he has performed his duty in
the most accurate and conscientious manner, while the
young men deluded by him really believe that by the
absurd, and to them almost unintelligible, words which
they have just uttered, they are released during their
term of service from all obligations to their fellow-men,
and are bound by new and more imperative ties to the
duties of a soldier.</p>

<p>And this is done publicly, but not a man comes
forward to say to the deceived and the deceivers,
"Come to your senses and go your way; this is all a
base and treacherous lie; it imperils not only your
bodies, but your souls."</p>

<p>No one does this. On the contrary, as if in derision,
after they have all been enrolled and are about to depart,
the colonel enters the hall where these poor, drunken,
and deluded creatures are locked in, and with a solemn
air, calls out to them in military fashion: "Good day,
men! I congratulate you upon entering <em>the Czar's service</em>."
And they, poor fellows, mumble in their semi-drunken
way, a reply which has already been taught
them, to the effect that it fills their hearts with joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>The expectant crowd of fathers, mothers, and wives
is still standing at the gates. Women, with tear-worn,
wide-open eyes, watch the door. Suddenly it opens
and the men come rolling out, assuming an air of
bravado, the Petruhas, Vanuhas, and Makars, now
enrolled, trying to avoid the eyes of their relatives,
pretending not to see them. At once break out the
sobs and cries of the wives and mothers. Some of
the men clasp them in their arms, weeping, some put
on a devil-may-care look, others make an attempt to
console them. The wives, the mothers, realizing that
they are now abandoned, without support, for three
or four years, cry and wail bitterly. The fathers say
little; they only sigh and make a clicking sound with
their tongues that indicates their grief; they know that
they are about to lose that help which they have reared
and trained their sons to render; that when their sons
return they will no longer be sober and industrious
laborers, but soldiers, weaned from their former life of
simplicity, grown dissolute, and vain of their uniforms.</p>

<p>Now the whole crowd has departed, driving down
the street in sleighs to the taverns and inns, and louder
grows the chorus of mingled sobs, songs, and drunken
cries, the moaning and muttering of the wives and
mothers, the sounds of the accordion, the noise of
altercations.</p>

<p>All repair to the eating-houses and taverns, from the
traffic of which part of the revenue of the government
is derived, and there they give themselves up to drink,
stupefying their senses so that they care nothing for
the injustice done to them.</p>

<p>Then they spend several weeks at home, drinking
nearly all the time.</p>

<p>When the day arrives, they are driven like cattle to
the appointed place, where they are drilled in military
exercises by those who a few years ago, like themselves,
were deceived and brutalized. During the instructions
the means employed are lying, blows, and <em>vodka</em>. And
before the year is over the good, kindly, and intelligent
fellows will have become as brutal as their teachers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>"Suppose your father were arrested and attempted
escape," I once suggested to a young soldier, "what
would you do?"</p>

<p>"It would be my duty to thrust my bayonet through
his body," he replied, in the peculiar, meaningless monotone
of the soldier. "And if he ran I should shoot,"
he added, taking pride apparently in thinking what he
should do if his father attempted to run.</p>

<p>When a good young fellow is reduced to a condition
lower than that of the brute, he is ready for those who
wish to use him as an instrument of violence. He is
ready. The man is lost, and a new instrument of violence
has been created. And all this goes on throughout
Russia in the autumn of every year, in broad
daylight, in the heart of a great city, witnessed by all the
inhabitants, and the stratagem is so skilfully managed,
that though men at the bottom of their hearts realize
its infamy, still they have not the power to throw off the
yoke.</p>

<p>After our eyes are once opened, and we view this
frightful delusion in its true light, it is astonishing that
preachers of Christianity and morality, teachers of
youth, or even those kindly and sensible parents who
are to be found in every community, can advocate any
principles of morality whatever in the midst of a society
where torture and murder are openly recognized as
constituting indispensable conditions in human life,&mdash;openly
acknowledged by all churches and governments,&mdash;where
certain men among us must be always ready
to murder their brethren, and where any of us may
have to do the same.</p>

<p>Not to speak of Christian doctrine, how are children,
how are youths, how are any to be taught morality,
while the principle that murder is required in order to
maintain the general welfare is taught; when men are
made to believe that murder is lawful, that some men,
and any of us may be among them, must kill and torture
their neighbors, and commit every kind of crime at the
command of those in authority? If this principle is
right, then there is not, nor can there be, any doctrine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
of morality; might is right, and there is no other law.
This principle, which some seek to justify on the hypothesis
of the struggle for existence, in fact dominates
society.</p>

<p>What kind of moral doctrine can that be which permits
murder for any object whatsoever? It is as impossible
as a mathematical problem which would affirm
that 2 = 3. It may be admitted that 2 = 3 looks like
mathematics, but it is not mathematics at all. Every
code of morals must be founded first of all upon the
acknowledgment that human life is to be held sacred.</p>

<p>The doctrine of an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,
and a life for a life, has been revoked by Christianity
because that doctrine was but the justification of immorality,
a semblance of justice, but without meaning. Life
is a substance which can neither be weighed, measured,
nor compared; hence the taking of one life for another
has no sense. Moreover, the aim of every social law is
amelioration of human life. How, then, can the destruction
of certain lives improve the condition of other
lives? The destruction of life is not an act that tends
to improve it; it is suicide.</p>

<p>To destroy human life, and call it justice, may be
likened to the act of a man who, having lost one arm,
cuts off the other, by way of making matters even.</p>

<p>Not to speak of the deceit of presenting the most
shocking crimes in the light of a duty, of the shocking
abuse of using Christ's name and authority in order to
confirm acts which he condemned, how can men, looking
at the matter from the standpoint merely of personal
safety, suffer the existence of the shocking, senseless,
cruel, and dangerous force which every organized government,
supported by the army, represents?</p>

<p>The most violent and rapacious band of robbers is
less to be feared than such an organization. Even the
authority of the leader of a band of robbers is more or
less limited by the will of each individual member of the
band, who, retaining a certain degree of independence,
has the right to oppose acts with which he does not
agree. But the authority of men who form part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
an organized government, maintained by the army with
its present system of discipline, is unlimited. When
their master, be he Boulanger, Pugatchov, or Napoleon,
issues his commands, there is no crime too hideous for
those who form part of the government and the army
to commit.</p>

<p>It must often occur to one who sees conscriptions,
drills, and military man&oelig;uvers taking place, who sees
police going about with loaded revolvers, sentinels
armed with bayonets,&mdash;to one who hears from morning
till night, as I do (in the district of Hamovniky,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> where
I live), the whirring balls and the concussion as they
strike the target,&mdash;to ask why these things are tolerated.
And when one sees in the same city, where every
attempt at violence is at once suppressed, where even
the sale of powder or medicines is prohibited, where
a doctor is not allowed to practice without a diploma,
thousands of disciplined men, controlled by one individual,
being trained for murder, one cannot help asking
how men who have any regard for their own safety can
calmly endure such a condition of affairs, and allow
it to continue? Leaving aside the question of the immorality
and pernicious influence of it, what could be
more dangerous? What are they thinking of,&mdash;I speak
not now of Christians, Christian pastors, philanthropists,
or moralists, but simply those who value their lives,
their safety, their welfare? Granting that power is at
present in the hands of a moderate ruler, it may fall
to-morrow into those of a Biron, an Elizabeth, a Catharine,
a Pugatchov, a Napoleon. And even though the
ruler be moderate to-day, he may become a mere savage
to-morrow; he may be succeeded by an insane or half-insane
heir, like the King of Bavaria or the Emperor
Paul.</p>

<p>It is not only those who fill the highest offices, but all
the lesser authorities scattered over the land&mdash;the chiefs
of police, the commanders of companies, even the <i lang="cs" xml:lang="cs">stanovoys</i><a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>&mdash;may
commit shocking crimes before they can be
dismissed; it is an everyday occurrence.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>
<p>Involuntarily one asks: How can men allow these
things to go on? How can they tolerate them with
any regard to their own personal safety?</p>

<p>It may be replied that some men do oppose it. (Those
who are deluded and live in subjection have nothing
either to tolerate or interdict.) Those who favor the
continuance of the present system are only those who
derive some special advantage from it. They favor it,
and even with the disadvantages of having an insane
or tyrannical man at the head of the government and
the army, the position is less disadvantageous to them
than if the present organization were abolished.</p>

<p>Whether his position be held under a Boulanger, a
Republic, a Pugatchov, or a Catharine,&mdash;the judge, the
police commissioner, the governor, the officer, will remain
in it. But if the system which assures their
positions were overthrown, they would lose them.
Therefore it is a matter of indifference to these men
whether one man or another be at the head of the
organization of violence. What they do fear is its
abolition; so they support it.</p>

<p>One wonders why men of independent means, who
are not obliged to become soldiers, the so-called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élite</i>
of society, enter military service in Russia, in England,
in Germany, in Austria, and even in France, and desire
the chance of killing? Why do parents, why do moral
men, send their children to military schools? Why do
mothers buy them such toys as helmets, swords, and
muskets? (No child of a peasant ever plays at being
a soldier.) Why do kindly men and women, who can
have no manner of interest in war, go into ecstasies
over the exploits of a man like Skobelev? Why do men
who are under no obligation to do it, and who receive
no pay for it, like Marshals of Nobility in Russia, devote
months to the service which demands such unremitting
labor, wearying to the minds as well as to the
body,&mdash;the enlistment of recruits? Why do all emperors
and kings wear a military dress, why do they
have drills and parades and military rewards? Why are
monuments built to generals and conquerors? Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
do wealthy and independent men regard it as an honor
to occupy the position of lackeys to kings, to flatter
them and feign a belief in their special superiority?
Why do men who have long since ceased to believe
in the medieval superstitions of the Church still constantly
and solemnly pretend to do so, and thus support
a sacrilegious and demoralizing institution? Why is the
ignorance of the people so zealously preserved, not only
by the government, but by men of the higher classes?
Why do they so energetically denounce every attempt
to overthrow popular superstition and to promote popular
education? Why do historians, novelists, and poets,
who can derive no benefit in exchange for their flattery,
paint in such glowing colors the emperors, kings, and
generals of bygone times? Why do the so-called scientists
devote their lives to formulate theories that violence
committed on the people by power is legitimate violence&mdash;is
right?</p>

<p>One often wonders why an artist or a woman of the
world, neither of whom, it would seem, ordinarily take
much interest in sociological or military questions&mdash;why
should they condemn strikes among workmen, or
advocate war with such partizan zeal?</p>

<p>But one ceases to feel surprise when one realizes that
the members of the higher classes possess the keenest
insight, an intuitive perception, as it were, concerning
those conditions which are friendly and those which are
hostile to the organization upon whose existence their
privileges depend.</p>

<p>It is true that the woman of society does not deliberately
argue thus: "Were there no capitalists, or armies
to defend them, my husband would have no money, and
I should have neither <em>salon</em> nor fashionable gowns;" nor
does the artist tell himself, in so many words, that if his
pictures are to be sold there must be capitalists, defended
by armies, to buy them; yet instinct, here doing
duty for reason, is their surest guide. This instinct
guides, with rare exceptions, all men who support those
political, religious, and economic institutions which are
advantageous to themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>But is it possible that men who belong to the higher
classes defend this organization only because it is for
their own advantage? They surely cannot fail to see
that as an organization it is irrational, incompatible with
the present consciousness of men, with public opinion,
and that it is fraught with danger. Good, intelligent,
honest men who belong to the ruling class cannot but
suffer from such contradictions, nor can they close their
eyes to the dangers that menace them.</p>

<p>And is it possible that the millions of men of the lower
classes can go on calmly committing deeds which are so
manifestly criminal, such as are the murders and tortures
which they commit, simply from fear of punishment?
Surely these things could not exist were not the falsehood
and brutality of their actions hidden from all
classes of men by the system of the political organization.</p>

<p>When such deeds are committed, there are so many
instigators, participants, and abettors that no single
individual feels himself morally responsible.</p>

<p>Assassins compel all the witnesses of an assassination
to strike the body of the victim, with the intention of
dividing the responsibility among the greatest number
possible. And whenever those crimes by the aid of
which the state system is maintained are to be committed,
this same thing is observed. The rulers of State
always endeavor to involve the greatest possible number
of citizens in the participation of the crimes which it is
to their interest to have committed.</p>

<p>In these latter days this is made especially evident
by the drawing of citizens on the jury in courts of law,
by drafting them into the army as soldiers, and into
the communal or legislative administration as electors
or elected.</p>

<p>As in a wicker basket all the ends are so carefully
interwoven that they cannot be seen, so is it with the
responsibility for crime. Individual responsibilities are
so manipulated that no man perceives precisely what
he is incurring.</p>

<p>In olden times tyrants were responsible for the
crimes which were committed, but in the present age<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
the most frightful crimes are perpetrated, such as
would hardly have been possible in the time of Nero,
and still no one is held responsible.</p>

<p>Some demand the crime, some propose it, some determine
it, some confirm it, some order it, some execute
it.</p>

<p>Women and old men are hung, are flogged to death&mdash;even
quite innocent people, as was recently the
case with us in Russia, in the affair of the factory at
Uzova; or, as is done all over in Europe and America,
in the struggle with anarchists and other revolutionists,
hundreds, thousands of men are shot, are killed;
or, as happens in time of war, millions of men are
massacred; or, as is happening always, the souls of
men are destroyed by solitary confinement, by the
debauchery of barrack life&mdash;and no one is responsible.</p>

<p>On the lower scale of the social ladder are posted
soldiers armed with muskets, pistols, swords; they go
about doing violence and killing, and through their
doing so force other men to become soldiers like themselves,
and yet they never dream that the responsibility
rests on their shoulders; they shift it on to their
superiors, who give the orders.</p>

<p>The czars, the presidents, the ministers of State,
the general assemblies, order tortures, murders, conscriptions,
and as they enjoy the absolute assurance
that they rule by the grace of God or by the will of the
society they govern, and that that society demands
from them what they order, they cannot regard themselves
as responsible.</p>

<p>Between these two classes we find a number of intermediaries,
who take charge of the executions, tortures,
conscriptions, and they, too, wash their hands of
all responsibility, alleging on the one hand the orders
of their superiors, and on the other that it is for such
as themselves, who stand lower on the social ladder, to
do these things.</p>

<p>The power that demands and the power that fulfils
commands, the two extremes of governmental organization,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
unite like the two ends of a chain, each depending
on and supporting the other, and all the
intervening links.</p>

<p>Were it not for the conviction that there are men
who assume the whole responsibility of such deeds,
no soldier would lift his hand to torture or murder his
fellow-man. Were it not for the conviction that the
nation demands it, no king, emperor, president, or
assembly would venture to issue commands for murder
and torture. Were it not that he believes that there
are men above him who assume the responsibility of
his actions, and others below him whose welfare requires
this treatment, no man of the intermediate class
would ever perform the functions committed to him.</p>

<p>The organization of the State is such that on whatever
position of the social ladder a man may stand, his
irresponsibility remains intact. The higher he stands,
the more liable he is to feel the pressure brought to
bear on him from below, urging him to issue commands,
and the less likely he will be to be influenced
by orders from above, and <em>vice versa</em>.</p>

<p>But it is not enough that all men bound by the
organization of the State transfer their responsibility
from one to the other,&mdash;the peasant, for instance, who
becomes a soldier to the merchant who has become
an officer; the officer to the noble who occupies the
position of governor; the governor to the minister of
State; the minister to the sovereign; and the sovereign
who in his turn shifts the responsibility upon
all,&mdash;officials, nobles, merchants, peasants. Not only
do men in this way merely free themselves from all
sense of responsibility for their actions, but because, as
they adapt themselves to fulfil the requirements of
political organizations, they so constantly, persistently,
and strenuously assure themselves and others that all
men are not equal that they begin to believe it sincerely
themselves. Thus we are assured that some
men are superior and must be especially honored and
obeyed; while, on the other hand, we are assured in
every way that others are inferior, and therefore bound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
to obey without murmur the commands of their superiors.</p>

<p>It is to this inequality,&mdash;the exaltation of some
upon the abasement of others,&mdash;that we may chiefly
attribute the incapacity which men display for discerning
the folly of the existing system, with the cruelty
and deceptions committed by some, and suffered by
others.</p>

<p>There are certain men who have been made to believe
that they are possessed of a peculiar importance
and greatness, who have become so intoxicated by
their imaginary superiority that they cease to realize
their responsibility for the actions they commit; others
who, on the contrary, have been told that they are insignificant
beings, and that it is their duty to submit
to those above them, and, as the natural result of this
continual state of degradation, fall into a strange condition
of stupefied servility, and in this state they, too,
lose all sense of responsibility for their actions. And
as to the intermediate class, subservient to those above
them, and yet to a certain extent regarding themselves
as superiors, they are apt to be both servile and arrogant,
and they also lose the sense of responsibility.</p>

<p>One needs but to glance at any official of high rank
in the act of reviewing the troops. Accompanied by
his staff, mounted on a magnificently caparisoned
charger, equipped in a brilliant uniform, displaying
all his decorations, he rides in front of the ranks,
while the band plays martial music and the soldiers
present arms, standing, as they do, as though verily
petrified with servility,&mdash;one has but to see this to
understand how in such moments, under such conditions,
both generals and soldiers might commit deeds
which they never would have dreamed of committing.</p>

<p>But the intoxication to which men succumb under
conditions like parades, pageants, religious ceremonies,
and coronations, though acute, is not enduring, while
there is another which is chronic, shared by all who
have any authority whatsoever, from the Czar to the
policemen on the street, shared, too, by the masses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
who submit to authority in a state of stupefied servility,
and who by way of justifying their submission,
after the usual manner of slaves, ascribe the greatest
importance and dignity to those whom they obey.</p>

<p>It is this delusion in regard to human inequality
and the consequent intoxication of power and stupefaction
of servility, which makes it possible for those
who are associated in a state organization to commit
crimes and suffer no remorse.</p>

<p>Under the influence of this intoxication,&mdash;there is
an intoxication of servility as well as of power,&mdash;men
seem to others, no less than to themselves, not the
ordinary human beings which they really are, but
specially privileged beings,&mdash;nobles, merchants, governors,
judges, officers, kings, statesmen, soldiers, having
no longer ordinary human duties, but only the
duties of the class to which they belong.</p>

<p>Thus the landed proprietor who prosecuted the peasants
on account of the forest did so because he did not
regard himself as an ordinary man, with the same rights
as the peasants, his neighbors, but as a great landowner
and a member of the nobility, and, as such, exalted by
the intoxication of authority, felt himself insulted by the
opposition of the peasants. And regardless of the consequences,
he sends in his petition to be reinstated in his
pretended rights. The judges who rendered an unfair
decision in his favor, did so because they fancied themselves
different from ordinary men, who are guided only
by truth; under the spell of the intoxication of authority,
they believed themselves the guardians of a justice which
cannot err; and at the same time, under the influence of
servility, they considered themselves obliged to apply
certain texts set forth in a certain book and called the
laws; and all the other persons who took part in this
affair, from the representatives of higher authority down
to the last soldier ready to fire upon his brother,&mdash;they
all accepted themselves in their conventionally accredited
characters. Not one asked himself if he should take
part in an act which his conscience reprobated, but each
accepted himself as one who had simply to fulfil a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
function; let it be the Czar, anointed of God, an
exceptional being called to look after the welfare of a
hundred million men; let it be the noble; the priest,
the recipient of grace through ordination; the soldier,
bound by oath to fulfil commands without hesitation,&mdash;it
is the same with all.</p>

<p>All their activity, past, present, and future, is stimulated
by a like intoxicating influence. If they had not
the firm conviction that the title of king, statesman,
governor, judge, landowner, marshal of nobility, officer,
or soldier is of serious import and necessity, not one of
them could contemplate without horror and disgust his
own share in the deeds done in these latter days.</p>

<p>Arbitrary distinctions, established hundreds of years
ago, recognized for hundreds of years, described by special
names and distinguished by special dress, sanctioned by
all kinds of solemnities calculated to influence men
through their emotions, have been so thoroughly impressed
upon the human imagination that men have
forgotten the common, everyday aspects of life; they
look upon themselves and others from a point of view
dependent upon outward conditions, and regard their
own acts and those of their neighbors accordingly.</p>

<p>Here, for instance, we see a man of advanced years, a
man perfectly in possession of his senses, who, because
he has been decorated with some bauble, and is attired
in a ridiculous habit, or because he is the holder of certain
keys, or has received a bit of blue ribbon fitter for
the wear of a coquettish child, when he is called general,
chamberlain, chevalier of the order of St. Andrew, or
some such absurdity, becomes at once proud, arrogant,
happy; if, on the contrary, he fails to get the gewgaw or
the nickname he expected, he becomes unhappy and ill,
really to the point of sickness.</p>

<p>Or let us take a still more remarkable case. A man,
morally sane, young, free, and absolutely safe from want,
has no sooner received the name of district-attorney, of
<em>Zemsky Nachalnik</em>, than he pounces upon some luckless
widow, takes her from her small children, and throws her
into jail, all because the poor woman has been secretly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
selling wine, and thus depriving the treasury of 25 roubles'
revenue. This man feels no remorse. Another still
more surprising case is that of a man, ordinarily kind
and good, who, because he wears a uniform or carries a
medal, and is told that he is a keeper [<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garde-champêtre</i>]
or custom-house officer, considers himself justified in
shooting men down, and no one ever dreams of blaming
him for it, nor does he think himself in the wrong; but
if he failed to fire upon his fellow-men he would then
indeed be culpable. I say nothing of judges and jurymen,
who condemn men to death, nor of troops, who
slaughter thousands without a vestige of remorse, because
they are told that they are not in the position of
ordinary men, but are jurymen, judges, generals, soldiers.</p>

<p>This abnormal and surprising state of affairs is formulated
in words like these: "As a man, I sympathize with
him, but as a keeper, a judge, a general, a czar, or a soldier,
I must torture or murder him."</p>

<p>So it is in this present case; men are on the way to
slaughter and torment their famine-stricken brethren, admitting
all the while that in this dispute between the peasants
and the landowner the former are in the right (all
the superior officials told me so). They know that the
peasants are miserable, poor, and hungry, and that the
landowner is wealthy and one who inspires no sympathy,
and yet these men are going to kill the peasants in order
that this landowner may gain 3000 roubles; and all because
they regard themselves at the moment not as men,
but one as a governor, another as a general of gendarmerie,
another as an officer, or as soldiers, as the case
may be, and bound not by the eternal laws of the human
conscience, but by the accidental, transitory demands of
their positions.</p>

<p>However strange it may appear, the only explanation
of this surprising phenomenon is that men are like those
under hypnotic influence, who, as suggested by the hypnotizers,
imagine themselves in certain conditions. Thus,
for instance, when it is suggested to a hypnotized patient
that he is lame, he proceeds to limp; that he is blind,
he ceases to see; that he is an animal, and he begins to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
bite. And this is the state of all those who put their
social and political duties before, and to the detriment
of, their duties as human beings.</p>

<p>The essential characteristic of this condition is, that
men, influenced by the thought that has been suggested
to them, are unable to weigh their own actions, and simply
obey the suggestion that has been communicated to
them.</p>

<p>The difference between men artificially hypnotized and
those under the influence of governmental suggestion
consists in this,&mdash;that to the former their imagined environment
is suggested suddenly by one person, and the
suggestion operates only for a short time; whereas to
the latter, their imagined position has been the result of
gradual suggestion, going on, not for years, but for generations,
and proceeds not from a single individual, but
from their entire circumstances.</p>

<p>"But," it will be objected, "always, in all societies,
the majority of men, all the children, all the women,
absorbed in the duties and cares of motherhood, all the
great mass of workers, who are completely absorbed by
their labor, all those of weak mind, all the enfeebled,
the many who have come under the subjection of nicotine,
alcohol, opium, or what not,&mdash;all these are not in
a position to think for themselves, and consequently they
submit to those who stand on a higher intellectual level,
or they simply act according to domestic or social tradition,
or in accordance with public opinion,&mdash;and in their
acting thus there is nothing abnormal or contradictory."</p>

<p>Indeed, there is nothing unnatural in it, and the readiness
with which those who reason but little submit to the
guidance of men who stand on a higher plane of consciousness
is a universal phenomenon, and one without
which social life could not be. The minority submit to
principles which they have considered for themselves,
and in consequence of the accordance of these principles
with their reason; the rest of men, the majority, submit
to the same principles, not because of personal apprehension
of their validity, but because public opinion
demands it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>Such submission to public opinion of men who can
think but little for themselves has nothing abnormal
about it so long as public opinion maintains its unity.</p>

<p>But there is a period when the higher forms of truth,
having been revealed to the few, are in process of transmission
to the many; and when the public opinion
which was based on a lower plane of consciousness has
already begun to waver, to give place to the new, ready
to be established. And now men begin to view their
own and other men's actions in the light of their new
consciousness, while, influenced by inertia and tradition,
they still continue to apply principles which were the
outcome of the once highest consciousness, but which
are now distinctly opposed to it. Hence it is that men
find themselves in an abnormal position, and that, while
realizing the necessity of conforming to this new public
opinion, they lack courage to abandon conformity to the
old one. This is the attitude which men, not only the
men on the train, but the greater part of mankind,
occupy toward Christian truths.</p>

<p>The attitude of those who belong to the upper classes,
and who have all the advantages of high position, is the
same as that of the lower classes who obey implicitly
every command that is given to them.</p>

<p>Men of the ruling classes, who have no reasonable
explanation of their privileges, and who in order to
retain them are forced to repress all their nobler and
more humane tendencies, try to persuade themselves of
the necessity of their superior position; while the lower
classes, stultified and oppressed by labor, are kept by
the higher classes in a state of constant subjection.</p>

<p>This is the only possible explanation of the amazing
phenomena which I witnessed on the train on the 9th
of September, when men, naturally kindly and inoffensive,
were to be seen going with an easy conscience
to commit the most cruel, contemptible and idiotic of
crimes.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that they are devoid of the conscience
which should forbid them to do these things, as
was the case with the men who, centuries ago, tortured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
their fellow-men, scourged them to death, and burned
them at the stake;&mdash;nay, it does exist in them, but it
is kept dormant; auto-suggestion, as the psychologist
calls it, keeps it thus among the upper classes, while
the soldiers, the executioners, are under the hypnotic
influence of the classes above them.</p>

<p>Conscience may slumber for a time, but it is not dead,
and in spite of suggestion and auto-suggestion, it still
whispers; yet a little while and it will awaken.</p>

<p>One might compare these men to a person under the
influence of hypnotism, to whom it has been suggested
that he shall commit some act contrary to his conception
of right and wrong, as, for example, to murder his
mother or his child. He feels himself so far coerced
by the suggestion given him that he cannot refrain;
and yet as the appointed time and place draw near, he
seems to hear the stifled voice of conscience reviving,
and he begins to draw back, he tries to awaken himself.
And no one can tell whether or not hypnotic suggestion
will conquer in the end; all depends on the relative
strength of conflicting influences.</p>

<p>So it was with the soldiers on that train, so it is with
all men of our period who take part in state violence
and profit by it.</p>

<p>There was a time when, having gone forth to do violence
and murder, to terrify by an example, men did not
return until they had performed their mission, and then
they suffered no doubt or remorse; but having done their
fellow-men to death, they placidly returned to the bosom
of their families, caressed their children, and with jest
and laughter gave themselves up to all the pure joys of
the hearth.</p>

<p>The men who were then benefited by violence, landed
proprietors and men of wealth, believed their own interests
to have a direct connection with these cruelties. It
is different now, when men know, or at least suspect,
the real reason why they do these things. They may
close their eyes and try to silence their consciences, but
neither those who commit such outrages, nor those who
order them, can longer fail to discern the significance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
of their acts. It may be that they do not fully appreciate
it until they are on the point of committing the
deed, or in some cases not until after the deed has been
done. Those soldiers, for instance, who administered
the tortures during the riot at the Yuzovo factory, at
Nijni-Novgorod, Saratov, and Orel, did not fully apprehend
the significance of what they were doing until it
was all over; and now, both they who gave the orders,
and they who executed them, suffer agonies of shame
in the condemnation of public opinion and of their own
conscience. I have talked with some of the soldiers
about it; they either tried to change the subject or
spoke of it with horror and repugnance.</p>

<p>There are instances of men coming to their senses,
however, just as they are on the point of committing
deeds of the kind. I know of a sergeant who during
the riots was beaten by two peasants; he reported the
fact to the commander of his company, but on the following
day, when he saw the tortures inflicted upon
other peasants, he persuaded his superior officer to
destroy his report and to allow the peasants who had
beaten him to depart unpunished. I know of a case
where the soldiers appointed to shoot a prisoner refused
to obey; and of other occasions where the superior officers
have refused to direct tortures and executions.</p>

<p>The men who were in the train on the 9th of September
started with the intention of torturing and murdering
their fellow-men, but whether they would carry
out their intention one could not know. However each
one's share in the responsibility of this affair might be
concealed from him, however strong the hypnotic suggestion
among those taking part in it that they did so,
not as men, but as functionaries, and so could violate all
human obligations,&mdash;in spite of this,&mdash;the nearer they
approached their destination, the more they must have
hesitated about it.</p>

<p>It is impossible that the Governor should not pause
at the moment of giving the decisive order to begin to
murder and torture. He knows that the conduct of
the Governor at Orel has excited the indignation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
honorable men, and he himself, influenced by public
opinion, has repeatedly expressed his own disapproval
of the affair; he knows that the lawyer who ought to
have accompanied him distinctly refused to do so, denouncing
the whole affair as shameful; he knows that
changes are likely to take place in the government at
any moment, the result of which would be that those
who were in favor yesterday may be in disgrace to-morrow;
that if the Russian press remains silent, the
foreign press may give an account of this business that
might cover him with opprobrium. Already he feels
the influence of the new public opinion which is to
supersede and destroy the old one. Moreover, he has
no assurance that his subordinates may not at the last
moment refuse to obey him. He hesitates; it is impossible
to divine what he will do.</p>

<p>The functionaries and officers who accompany him
feel more or less as he does. They all know at the
bottom of their hearts that they are engaged in a shameful
business, that their share in it stains and degrades
them in the eyes of those persons whose opinion they
value. They know that a man who participates in
deeds like these feels shame in the presence of the
woman he loves. And like the Governor, they, too, feel
doubtful whether the soldiers will obey them at the last
moment. What a contrast to the self-assurance of their
bearing on the platform of the station! Not only do
they suffer, but they actually hesitate, and it is partly to
hide their inward agitation that they assume an air of
bravado. And this agitation increases as they draw
nearer to their destination.</p>

<p>And, indeed, the entire body of soldiers, although
they give no outward sign, and seem utterly submissive,
are really in the same state of mind.</p>

<p>They are no longer like the soldiers of former days,
who gave up the natural life of labor, and surrendered
themselves to debauchery, rapine, and murder, as the
Roman legions did, or the veterans of the Thirty Years'
War, or even those soldiers of more modern times, whose
term of service lasted twenty-five years. Now they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
for the most part men newly taken from their families,
with all the memories of the wholesome, rational life from
which they have been torn still fresh in their minds.</p>

<p>These young men, peasants for the most part, know
what they are going to do; they know that the land-owners
generally ill-treat the peasants, and that this
probably is a case in point. Furthermore, the majority
of them can read, and the books they read are not
always in favor of the service; some even demonstrate
its immorality. They find comrades who are independent
thinkers, volunteers and young officers, and the
seed of doubt respecting the merit and rectitude of
such deeds as they are about to commit has already
been sown in their minds. True, they have all been
subjected to that ingenious discipline, the work of centuries,
which tends to kill the spirit of independence in
every man, and are so accustomed to automatic obedience
that at the words of command, "Fire along the
line!... Fire!" and so forth, their muskets are raised
mechanically, and they perform the customary movements.
But now, "Fire!" means something more than
firing at a target; it means the murder of their abused,
downtrodden fathers and brothers, who are grouped
yonder in the street with their wives and children, gesticulating
and crying out one does not know what.</p>

<p>There they are: here a man with thin beard, clad
in a patched <em>kaftan</em>, with bast shoes on his feet, just like
the father left behind in the province of Kazan or Ryazan;
there another, with gray beard and bowed shoulders,
leaning on a stout staff, just like the grandfather;
and here a youth, with big boots and red shirt, just like
himself a year ago,&mdash;the soldier who is about to shoot
him. And there is a woman, with her bast shoes and
petticoat, like the mother he left behind him.</p>

<p>And he must fire upon them!</p>

<p>And God alone knows what each soldier will do at
the supreme moment. The slightest suggestion that
they ought not to do it, that they must not do it,&mdash;a
single word or hint,&mdash;would be enough to make them
pause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>Every one of these men at the moment of action will
be like one hypnotized, to whom it has been suggested
to chop a log, who, as he approaches the object which
is told to him is a log, sees as he raises the ax that it is
not a log at all, but his own brother who lies sleeping
there. He may accomplish the act which has been
suggested to him, or he may awake at the moment of
committing it. It is the same with these men. If
they do not awaken, then will a deed be done as
shocking as that committed in Orel, and the reign of
official hypnotism will thereby gain new power. If they
awaken, then not only will the deed remain undone,
but many of those who hear of their refusal to do it will
free themselves from the suggestion under whose influence
they have hitherto acted, or at least will think of
the possibility of doing so.</p>

<p>If only a few of these men come to their senses, and
refuse to do the deed, and fearlessly express their opinion
of the wickedness of such deeds, even such a few
men might enable the rest to throw off the suggestion
under the influence of which they act, and such evil
deeds would not be done.</p>

<p>And another thing: if but a few of those persons who
are simply spectators of the affair would, from their
knowledge of other affairs of the same kind, boldly express
their opinion to those engaged in it, and point out
to them their folly, cruelty, and criminality, even this
would not be without a salutary influence.</p>

<p>This is precisely what happened in the case of Tula.
Partly because certain persons expressed reluctance
to take a part in the affair; because a lady passenger
and others showed their indignation at a railway station;
because one of the colonels whose regiment was summoned
to reduce the peasants to obedience declared
that soldiers are not executioners,&mdash;because of these
and other apparently trifling influences the affair took
on a different aspect, and the troops, on arriving, did
not commit outrages, but contented themselves with
cutting down the trees and sending them to the landowner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>Had it not been that certain of these men conceived a
distinct idea that they were doing wrong, and had not
the idea got abroad, the occurrences at Orel would have
been repeated. Had the feeling been stronger, perhaps
the Governor and his troops would not have gone so far
as even to fell the trees and deliver them to the landowner.
Had it been more powerful still, perhaps the
Governor would not have dared even to set out for
Tula; its influence might even have gone so far as to
prevent the Minister from framing, and the Emperor
from confirming, such decrees.</p>

<p>All depends, as we come therefore to see, upon the degree
of consciousness that men possess of Christian truth.</p>

<p>Hence, let all men to-day who wish to promote the
welfare of mankind direct their efforts toward the development
of this consciousness of Christian truth.</p>

<p>But, strange to say, those men who nowadays talk most
of the amelioration of human life, and who are the acknowledged
leaders of public opinion, declare this to be precisely
the wrong thing to do, and that there are more effectual
expedients for improving human existence. They insist
that any improvement in the conditions of human
life must be accomplished, not through individual moral
effort, nor through the propagation of truth, but through
progressive modifications in the general material conditions
of life. Therefore, they say, individual effort
should be devoted to the gradual reform of the everyday
conditions of life; and seeing that any individual
profession of the truth which may happen to be incompatible
with the existing order is harmful, because it
provokes, on the part of the government, an opposition
which prevents the individual from continuing efforts
which may be of utility to society.</p>

<p>According to this theory, all changes in the life of
mankind proceed from the same causes that control the
lives of the brute creation.</p>

<p>And all the religious teachers, like Moses and the
Prophets, Confucius, Lao Tze, Buddha, and Christ,
preached their doctrines, and their followers adopted
them, not because they divined and loved the truth, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
because the political, social, and, above all, the economical
conditions of the nations in whose midst these doctrines
found expression were favorable to their exposition
and development.</p>

<p>Therefore the principal activity of a man who wishes
to serve the world and to improve the condition of his
kind should be directed, according to this theory, not to
teaching and profession of the truth, but to the improvement
of the outward, political, social, and, above all,
economic conditions of life. The change in these conditions
may be accomplished by serving the government
and introducing liberal and progressive principles, by
contributing to the development of commerce, by propagating
socialistic principles, but, above all, by promoting
the diffusion of science.</p>

<p>According to this doctrine, it is a matter of no consequence
whether one profess the revealed truth or not;
there is no obligation to live in accordance with its precepts,
or to refrain from actions opposed to them,&mdash;as,
for instance, to serve the government, though one considers
its power detrimental; to profit by the organization
of capital, though one disapproves of it; to subscribe
to certain forms of religion, though one considers them
superstitions. Practise in the courts of law, though one
believes them to be corrupt; or enter the army, or take
the oath of allegiance, or indeed lie, or do anything that
is convenient. These things are trivial; for it is a matter
of vital importance, instead of challenging the prevailing
customs of the day, to conform to them, though they be
contrary to one's convictions, satisfied meanwhile to try
and liberalize the existing institutions, by encouraging
commerce, propagating socialistic doctrines, and generally
promoting <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soi-disant</i> science and civilization. According
to this convenient theory, it is possible for a man
to remain a landowner, a merchant, a manufacturer, a
judge, a functionary paid by the government, a soldier,
an officer, and at the same time to be humanitarian,
socialist, and revolutionary.</p>

<p>Hypocrisy, formerly growing only out of such religious
doctrines as that of original sin, redemption, the Church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
has in these latter days, by means of the new theory,
gained for itself a scientific basis, and those whose intellectual
habit of mind renders the hypocrisy of the Church
unendurable, are yet deceived by this new hypocrisy with
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cachet</i> of science. If in old times a man who professed
the doctrines taught by the Church could with a
clear conscience take part in any political crime, and
benefit by so doing, provided he complied with the external
forms of his faith, men of the present day, who
deny Christianity, and view the conduct of life from a
secular and scientific standpoint, are every whit as sure
of their own innocence, even of their lofty morality,
when they participate in and benefit by the evil-doings
of government.</p>

<p>It is not alone in Russia, but in France, England, Germany,
and America as well, that we find the wealthy
landed proprietor, who, in return for having allowed the
men who live on his estate and who supply him with the
products of the soil, extorts from these men, who are
often poverty-stricken, all that he possibly can. Whenever
these oppressed laborers make an attempt to gain something
for themselves from the lands which the rich man
calls his own, without first asking his consent, troops are
called out, who torture and put to death those who have
been bold enough to take such liberties.</p>

<p>By methods like this are claims to the ownership of
land made good. One would hardly imagine that a man
who lived in such a wicked and selfish manner could call
himself a Christian, or even liberal. One would think
that if a man cared to seem Christian or liberal, he would
at least cease to plunder and to torment his fellow-men
with the aid of the government, in order to vindicate his
claims to the ownership of land. And such would be
the case were it not for the metaphysical hypocrisy which
teaches that from a religious standpoint it is immaterial
whether one owns land or not, and that, from the scientific
point of view, for a single individual to give up his
land would be a useless sacrifice, without any effect on
the well-being of mankind, the amelioration of which can
only be brought about by a progressive modification of
outward conditions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, your modern landowner will, without the
least hesitation or doubt, organize an agricultural exhibition,
or a temperance society, or, through his wife and
daughters, distribute warm underclothing and soup to
three old women; and he will hold forth before the domestic
circle, or in society, or as a member of committees,
or in the public press, upon the gospel of love for mankind
in general and the agricultural class in particular,
that class which he never ceases to torment and oppress.
And those who occupy a similar position will believe in
him and sing his praises, and take counsel together upon
the best methods of improving the condition of those
very laboring classes they spend their lives in exploiting;
and for this purpose they suggest every possible expedient,
save that which would effect it,&mdash;namely, to desist
from robbing the poor of the land necessary for their
subsistence.</p>

<p>(A striking example of this hypocrisy was presented
by the Russian landowners during the struggle with the
famine of last year,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> a famine of which they were themselves
the cause, and by which they profited, not only
by selling bread at the highest price, but even by disposing
of the dried potato-plants for five roubles a <i lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">dessiatin</i>,
to be used as fuel by the freezing peasants.)</p>

<p>The business of the merchant, again (as is the case
with business of any kind), is based upon a series of
frauds; he takes advantage of the necessities of men by
buying his merchandise below, and selling it above, its
value. One would think that a man, the mainspring of
whose activity is what he himself in his own language
calls shrewdness, ought to feel ashamed of this, and
never dream of calling himself Christian or liberal while
he continues a merchant. But, according to the new
metaphysic of hypocrisy, he may pass for a virtuous man
and still pursue his evil career; the religious man has
but to believe, the liberal man but to coöperate, in the
reform of external conditions to promote the general
progress of commerce; the rest does not signify. So
this merchant (who, besides, often sells bad commodities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
adulterates, and uses false weights and measures, or deals
exclusively in commodities that imperil human life, such
as alcohol or opium) frankly considers himself, and is
considered by others,&mdash;always provided he only does
not cheat his colleagues in business and knavery, his
fellow-tradesmen,&mdash;a model of conscientiousness and
honesty. And if he spend one per cent of his stolen
money on some public institution, hospital, museum, or
school, men call him the benefactor of the people on
whose exploitation all his welfare depends; and if he
gives but the least part of this money to the Church or
to the poor, then is he deemed an exemplary Christian
indeed.</p>

<p>Take again the factory-owner, whose entire income is
derived from reducing the pay of his workmen to its lowest
terms, and whose whole business is carried on by forced
and unnatural labor, endangering the health of generations
of men. One would suppose that if this man professed
Christian or liberal principles he would cease to
sacrifice human lives to his interests. But, according to
the existing theory, he encourages industry, and it would
be a positive injury to society if he were to abandon his
operations, even supposing he were willing to do so. And,
too, this man, the cruel slave-driver of thousands of
human beings, having built for those injured in his service
minute houses, with gardens six feet in extent, or
established a fund, or a home for the aged, or a hospital,
is perfectly satisfied that he has more than atoned for
the moral and physical jeopardy into which he has
plunged so many lives; and he continues to live calmly,
proud of his work.</p>

<p>We find that the functionary, civil, military, or ecclesiastical,
who performs his duties to gratify his selfishness
or ambition, or, as is more usually the case, for the sake
of the stipend, collected in the shape of taxes from an
exhausted and crippled people,&mdash;if, by a rare exception,
he does not directly steal from the public treasury,&mdash;considers
himself, and is considered by his equals, a
most useful and virtuous member of society.</p>

<p>There are judges and other legal functionaries who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
know that their decisions have condemned hundreds and
thousands of unfortunate men to be torn from their
families and thrown into prison. There these hapless
beings are locked up in solitary confinement, or sent
to the galleys, where they go desperate and put an end
to themselves by starving themselves to death, by swallowing
glass, or by some such means. And who knows
what the mothers, wives, and children of these men suffer
by the separation and imprisonment, and the disgrace
of it,&mdash;who have vainly begged for pardon for their
sons, husbands, brothers, or that their lot may be a little
alleviated. But the judge or other legal functionary is so
primed with the current hypocrisy that he himself, his
colleagues, his wife, and his friends are all quite sure,
despite what he does, that he is a good and sensible man.
According to the current philosophy of hypocrisy, such
a man performs a duty of great importance to the public.
And this man, who has injured hundreds or thousands of
human beings, who owe it to him that they have lost their
belief in goodness and their faith in God, goes to church
with a benevolent smile, listens to the Bible, makes liberal
speeches, caresses his children, bestows moral lessons
upon them, for their edification, and grows sentimental
over imaginary suffering.</p>

<p>Not only these men, their wives and children, but the
entire community around them, all the teachers, actors,
cooks, jockeys, live by preying upon the life-blood of the
working-people, which in one way or another they absorb
like leeches. Every one of their days of pleasure costs
thousands of days in the lives of the workers. They see
the suffering and privation of these workmen, of their
wives and children, of their aged and feeble. They know
what punishments are visited upon those who attempt to
resist the organized system of pillage, but so far from
abandoning or concealing their luxurious habits, they
flaunt them in the faces of those whom they oppress and
by whom they are hated. All the while they assure
themselves and others that they have the welfare of the
working-man greatly at heart. On Sundays, clad in
rich garments, they drive in their carriages to churches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
where the mockery of Christianity is preached, and listen
there to the words of men who have learned their falsehoods
by heart. Some of these men wear stoles, some
wear white cravats; they all preach the doctrine of love
for one's neighbor, a doctrine belied by their daily lives.
And they have all grown so accustomed to playing this
part that they really believe themselves to be what they
pretend.</p>

<p>This universal hypocrisy, which has become to every
class of society at the present day like the air it breathes,
is so familiar that men are no longer exasperated by it.
It is very fitting that hypocrisy should signify acting or
playing of a part. It has become so much a matter of
course that it no longer excites surprise when the representatives
of Christ pronounce a blessing over murderers
as they stand in rank holding their guns in the position
which signifies, in military parlance, "for prayers," or
when the priests and pastors of various Christian sects
accompany the executioner to the scaffold, and, by lending
the sanction of their presence to murder, make men
believe it compatible with Christianity. (One minister
was present when experiments in "electrocution" took
place in the United States.) At the International Prison
Exposition recently held in St. Petersburg, where instruments
of torture, such as chains, and models of prison-cells
for solitary confinement,&mdash;means of torture worse
than the knout or the rod,&mdash;were on exhibition, sympathetic
ladies and gentlemen went to see them, and seemed
greatly entertained.</p>

<p>No one marvels to find liberal science insisting upon the
equality, fraternity, and liberty of men on the one hand,
while on the other it is striving to prove the necessity of
armies, executions, custom-houses, of censorship of the
press, of legalized prostitution, of the expulsion of foreign
labor, of the prohibition of emigration, and of the necessity
and justice of colonization established by the pillage
and extermination of whole races of so-called savages, etc.</p>

<p>They talk of what will happen when all men shall profess
what they call Christianity (by which they mean the
different conflicting creeds); when every one will be fed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
and clothed; when men will communicate with one
another all over the world by telegraph and telephones,
and will travel in balloons; when all working-men will
accept the doctrine of socialism; when the trade unions
will embrace many millions of men and possess millions
of money; when all men will be educated, will read the
papers, and be familiar with all the sciences.</p>

<p>But what good will this do if after all these improvements
men are still false to the truth?</p>

<p>The miseries of men are caused by disunion, and disunion
arises from the fact that men follow not truth, but
falsehood, of which there is no end. Truth is the only
bond by which men may be united; and the more
sincerely men strive after the truth the nearer they
approach to true unity.</p>

<p>But how are men to be united in the truth, or even approach
it, if they not only fail to proclaim the truth which
they possess, but actually think it useless to do so, and
pretend to believe in something which they know to be a
lie? In reality no improvement in the condition of mankind
is possible while men continue to hide the truth from
themselves, nor until they acknowledge that their unity,
and consequently their welfare, can be promoted only
by the spirit of truth; until they admit that to profess,
and to act in obedience to the truth as it has been revealed
to them, is more important than all things else.</p>

<p>Let all the material progress ever dreamt of by religious
and scientific men be made; let all men accept Christianity,
and let all the improvements suggested by the
Bellamys and Richets, with every possible addition and
correction, be carried out; and yet if the hypocrisy of
to-day still flourishes, if men do not make known the
truth that is within them, but go on pretending to believe
what they know to be untrue, showing respect where
they no longer feel it, their condition will never improve;
on the contrary, it will become worse. The more men
are raised above want, the more telegraphs, telephones,
books, newspapers, and reviews they possess, the more
numerous will be the channels for the diffusion of falsehood
and hypocrisy, and the more at variance and miserable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
will men become,&mdash;and it is even so at the present
time.</p>

<p>Let all those material changes take place, and still the
position of humanity will in no way be improved by them;
but let every man, so far as he is able, begin at once and
live up to his highest ideal of the truth or, at the least,
cease to defend a lie, then indeed should we see even in
this year of 1893 such an advance in the establishment
of the truth upon earth, and in the deliverance of mankind,
as could hardly be hoped for in a hundred years.</p>

<p>It was not without reason that the only harsh and denunciatory
words that Christ uttered were addressed to
hypocrites. It is neither theft, nor robbery, nor murder,
nor fornication, nor fraud, but falsehood, that particular
hypocritical falsehood, which destroys in men's conscience
the distinction between good and evil, which corrupts them
and takes from them the possibility of avoiding evil and
of seeking good, which deprives them of that which constitutes
the essence of a true human life,&mdash;it is this which
bars the way to all improvement. Those men who do
evil, knowing not the truth, inspire in the beholder compassion
for their victims and repugnance for themselves,
but they only injure the few whom they molest. Whereas
those men who, knowing the good, yet pursue the evil,
wearing all the while the mantle of hypocrisy, commit
a wrong, not only against themselves and their victims,
but also against thousands of other men who are deceived
by the falsehood under which they conceal the wrong.</p>

<p>Thieves, robbers, murderers, rogues, who commit acts
which they themselves, as well as other men, know to
be evil, serve as a warning to show men what is evil,
and make them hate it. Those, however, who steal,
rob, torture, and murder, justifying themselves by pretended
religious, scientific, or other motives, like the
landowners, merchants, factory-owners, and government
servants of the present time, by provoking imitation,
injure not only their victims, but thousands and
millions of men who are corrupted by their influence,
and who become so blinded that they cannot distinguish
the difference between good and evil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>One fortune acquired by trading in the necessaries of
life or in articles that tend to demoralize men, or by
speculations in the stock exchange, or by the acquisition
of cheap lands which subsequently rise in value by
reason of the increasing needs of the people, or by the
establishment of factories that endanger human health
and human lives, or by rendering civil or military service
to the State, or by any occupation that tends to the
demoralization of mankind,&mdash;a fortune acquired in any
of these ways, not only permitted, but approved by the
leaders of society, when, furthermore, it is supported
by a show of charity, surely demoralizes men more than
millions of thefts, frauds, or robberies,&mdash;sins committed
against the laws of the land and subject to judicial
prosecution.</p>

<p>A single enforcement of capital punishment, ordained
by men of education and wealth, sanctioned by the
approval of the Christian clergy, and declared to be an
act of justice essential to the welfare of the State, tends
far more to degrade and brutalize mankind than hundreds
and thousands of murders committed in passion
by the ignorant. A more demoralizing scene than the
execution suggested by Jukovsky, calculated as it is to
excite a feeling of religious exaltation, it would be difficult
to conceive.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>A war, even of the shortest duration,&mdash;with all its
customary consequences, the destruction of harvests,
the thefts, the unchecked debauchery and murders,
with the usual explanations of its necessity and justice,
with the accompanying glorification and praise bestowed
upon military exploits, upon patriotism, devotion to the
flag, with the assumption of tenderness and care for
the wounded,&mdash;will do more in one year to demoralize
men than thousands of robberies, arsons, and murders
committed in the course of centuries by individual men
carried away by passion.</p>

<p>The existence of one household, one not even extravagant
beyond the ordinary limits, esteeming itself virtuous
and innocent, which yet consumes the production of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
enough to support thousands of the men who live near
in poverty and distress, has a more degrading influence
on mankind than innumerable orgies of gross shopkeepers,
officers, or workmen who are addicted to drink
and debauchery, and who smash mirrors and crockery
by way of amusement.</p>

<p>One solemn procession, one religious service, or one
sermon from the pulpit, embodying a falsehood which
the preacher himself does not believe, does infinitely
more harm than thousands of frauds, adulterations of
food, etc.</p>

<p>Men talk of the hypocrisy of the Pharisees; but the
hypocrisy of our contemporaries far surpasses the comparatively
harmless sanctimoniousness of the Pharisees.
They at least had an outward religious law, whose fulfilment
may perhaps have prevented them from discerning
their duty toward their neighbors; indeed, those duties
had not then been distinctly defined. To-day there is
no such law. (I do not consider such gross and stupid
men as even now believe that sacraments or absolution
of the Pope can free them from sins.) On the contrary,
the law of the gospel, which in one form or another
we all profess, makes our duties perfectly plain. Indeed,
those precepts which were but vaguely indicated by
certain of the prophets have since been so clearly formulated,
have grown to be such truisms, that the very
school-boys and hack writers repeat them. Therefore
men of our times cannot feign ignorance concerning
them.</p>

<p>Those men who enjoy the advantages of the existing
system, and who are always protesting love for their
neighbor, without suspicion that their own lives are an
injury to their neighbors, are like the robber who,
caught with an uplifted knife, his victim crying desperately
for help, protests that he did not know that he
was doing anything unpleasant to the man whom he
was in the act of robbing and about to murder. Since
the denial of this robber and murderer would be of no
avail, his act being patent to all observers, it would seem
equally futile for our fellow-citizens, who live by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
sufferings of the oppressed, to assure themselves and
others that they desire the welfare of those whom they
never cease to rob, and that they had not realized the
nature of the methods by which their prosperity had
been attained.</p>

<p>We can no longer persuade ourselves that we do not
know of the one hundred thousand men in Russia alone
who have been shut up in galleys or in prisons for the
purpose of securing to us our property and our peace;
and that we do not know of the existence of those courts
of law at which we preside, to which we bring our accusations,
which sentence those men, who have attacked
our property or our lives, to the galleys, to imprisonment,
or to exile, where human beings, no worse than
they who have pronounced judgment upon them, become
degraded and lost; nor that we do not know that
everything that we possess has been won and is preserved
at the expense of murder and violence. We
cannot shut our eyes and pretend that we do not see
the policeman, who, armed with a revolver, paces before
our window, protecting us while we are eating our
excellent dinner, or when we are at the theater seeing
a new play; nor do not know of the existence of the
soldiers who will appear armed with guns and cartridges
whenever our property is menaced. We know perfectly
well that if we finish our dinner, see the new
play to its end, enjoy a merry-making at Christmas,
take a walk, go to a ball, a race, or a hunt, we owe it
to the policeman's revolver or the ball in the soldier's
musket, which will pierce the hungry belly of the disinherited
man who, with watering mouth, peeps round
the corner at our pleasures, and who might interrupt
them if the policeman or the soldiers in the barracks
were not ready to appear at our first call. Hence, as
the man who is caught in the act of robbery in broad
daylight cannot deny that he threatened his victim with
a knife for the purpose of stealing his purse, it might
be supposed that we could no longer represent to ourselves
and to others that the soldiers and policemen
whom we see around us are here, not for the purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
of protecting us, but to repulse foreign enemies, to
assure public order, to adorn by their presence public
rejoicings and ceremonies. We cannot pretend we do
not know that men are not fond of starving to death.
We know that they do not like to die of hunger, being
deprived of the right to earn their living from the soil
upon which they live, that they are not anxious to work
ten to fourteen hours a day underground, standing in
water, or in over-heated rooms, twelve or fourteen hours
a day, or at night, manufacturing articles which contribute
to our pleasures. It would seem impossible to
deny what is so evident, and yet it is what we do deny.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that there are people of the
wealthy class, and I am glad to say that I meet them
more and more frequently, particularly in the younger
generation and among women, who, on being reminded
by what means and at what a price their pleasures are
obtained, instantly admit the truth of it, and with bowed
heads exclaim: "Ah, do not tell us of it! If it is as
you say, one cannot live!" If, however, there are some
who are willing to admit their sin, though they know
not how to escape from it, still, the majority of men
nowadays have become so confirmed in hypocrisy that
they boldly deny facts that are patent to every one who
has eyes.</p>

<p>"It is all nonsense," they say. "No one forces the
people to work for the landowners or in the factories.
It is a matter of mutual accommodation. Large properties
and capital are indispensable, because they enable
men to organize companies and provide work for the
laboring classes, and the work in mills and factories is
by no means so dreadful as you represent it. When
real abuses are found to exist, the government and
society in general take measures to abolish them and to
render the labor of the working-men easier and more
agreeable. The working-classes are used to physical
labor, and are not as yet capable of doing anything else.
The poverty of the people is caused neither by the
landowners nor by the tyranny of the capitalists; it
springs from other causes,&mdash;from ignorance, disorder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
and intemperance. We, the governing classes, who
counteract this state of poverty by wise administration;
and we, the capitalists, who counteract it by the multiplication
of useful inventions; and we, the liberals, who
contribute our share by instituting trade unions and by
diffusing education,&mdash;these are the methods by which
we promote the welfare of the people, without making
any radical change in our position. We do not wish all
to be poor like the poor; we wish all to be rich like the
rich.</p>

<p>"As to torturing and killing men for the purpose of
making them work for the rich, that is all sophistry;
the troops are sent out to quell disturbances when men,
not appreciating their advantages, rebel and disturb the
peace essential for the general welfare. It is equally
necessary to restrain malefactors, for whom prisons,
gallows, and the like are established. We are anxious
enough to abolish them as far as possible ourselves,
and are working for that purpose."</p>

<p>Hypocrisy, which nowadays is supported by two
methods, the quasi-religious and the quasi-scientific, has
attained such proportions, that if we did not live in its
atmosphere continually, it would be impossible to believe
that humanity could sink to such depths of self-deception.
Men have reached so surprising a state, their hearts
have become so hardened, that they look and do not
see; listen, and do not hear or understand.</p>

<p>For a long time they have been living a life that is
contrary to their conscience. Were it not for the aid of
hypocrisy they would be unable so to live, for such a
life, so opposed to conscience, can only continue because
it is veiled by hypocrisy.</p>

<p>And the greater the difference between the practice
and the conscience of men, the more elastic becomes
hypocrisy. Yet even hypocrisy has its limits, and I
believe that we have reached them.</p>

<p>Every man of the present day, with the Christian
consciousness that has involuntarily become his, may be
likened to a sleeper who dreams that he is doing what
even in his dream he knows he ought not to do. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
the depths of his dream-consciousness he realizes his
conduct, and yet seems unable to change his course,
and to cease doing that which he is aware he should
not do.</p>

<p>Then, in the progress of his dream, his state of mind
becoming less and less endurable, he begins to doubt
the reality of what has seemed so real, and makes a
conscious effort to break the spell that holds him.</p>

<p>The average man of our Christian world is in exactly
the same strait. He feels that everything going on
around him is absurd, senseless, and impossible; that
the situation is becoming more and more painful, that
it has indeed reached the crisis.</p>

<p>It is impossible that we of the present age, endowed
with the Christian conscience that has become a part
of our very flesh and blood as it were, who live with a
full consciousness of the dignity of man and the equality
of all men, who feel our need for peaceable relations
with each other and for the unity of all nations, should
go on living in such a way. It is impossible that all our
pleasures, all our satisfactions, should be purchased by
the sufferings and the lives of our brethren; impossible
that we should be ready at a moment's notice to rush
upon each other like wild beasts, one nation against
another, and relentlessly destroy the lives and labor of
men, only because one foolish diplomatist or ruler says
or writes something foolish to another.</p>

<p>It is impossible; and yet all men of our time see
that this is what does happen every day, and all wait
for the catastrophe, while the situation grows more and
more strained and painful.</p>

<p>And as a man in his sleep doubts the reality of his
dream and longs to awaken and return to real life, so the
average man of our day cannot, in the bottom of his
heart, believe the terrible situation in which he finds
himself, and which is growing worse and worse, to be
the reality. He longs to attain to a higher reality, the
consciousness of which is already within him.</p>

<p>And like this sleeper, who has but to make the conscious
effort to ask himself whether it be a dream, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
order to transform its seeming hopelessness into a
joyous awakening, our average man has but to make
a conscious effort and ask himself, "Is not all this an
illusion?" in order to feel himself forthwith like the
awakened sleeper, transported from an hypocritical and
horrible dream-world into a living, peaceful, and joyous
real one.</p>

<p>And for this he has no need of any heroic achievement;
he has only to make the effort prompted by his
moral consciousness.</p>

<p>But is man able to make this effort?</p>

<p>According to the existing theory, one indispensable
from the point of view of hypocrisy, man is not free
and may not change his life.</p>

<p>"A man cannot change his life, because he is not a
free agent. He is not a free agent, because his acts
are the result of preceding causes. And whatever he
may do, certain it is that preceding causes always determine
that a man must act in one way rather than in
another; therefore a man is not free to change his
life,"&mdash;thus argue the defenders of the metaphysic of
hypocrisy. And they would be perfectly right if man
were an unconscious and stationary being, incapable of
apprehending the truth, and unable to advance to a
higher state by means of it. But man is a conscious
being, able to grow more and more in the knowledge
of truth. Therefore if he be not free in his acts, the
causes of these acts, which consist in the recognition
simply of such and such truth, are yet within his
mastery.</p>

<p>So that if a man is not free to do certain acts, he is
yet free to work toward the suppression of the moral
causes which prevent their performance. He may be
likened to the engineer of a locomotive, who, though
not at liberty to change the past or present motion of
his engine, is yet free to determine its future progress.</p>

<p>No matter what an intelligent man may do, he adopts
a certain course of action only because he acknowledges
to himself that at the moment that course alone is the
right one; or because he has formerly recognized it as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
such, and now continues to act as he does through force
of habit, or through mental inertia.</p>

<p>Whether a man eats or abstains from food, whether
he works or rests, whether he avoids danger or seeks it,
he acts as he does because he considers it to be reasonable
at the time, or because previously he saw that the
truth consisted in acting in that way and not in another.</p>

<p>The admission or the denial of a certain truth depends
not on outward causes, but on certain conditions that
man finds within himself. Thus frequently, with all the
outward and, as it may seem, favorable conditions for
recognizing the truth, one may reject it, while another
may receive it under the most unfavorable conditions,
and without apparent motives. As it is said in the
gospel: "No man can come to me, except the Father
which hath sent me draw him;"&mdash;that is to say, the
recognition of truth, which is the cause of all the manifestations
of a man's life, does not depend on outward
conditions, but on certain inherent qualities which escape
recognition.</p>

<p>Therefore a man who is not free in his acts still feels
himself free in regard to the cause of his acts; that is,
in regard to the recognition or non-recognition of truth.</p>

<p>Thus a man who, under the influence of passion, has
committed a deed contrary to the truth he knows, still
remains free in recognizing or denying the truth; in
other words, denying the truth, he may consider his act
necessary and justify himself in committing it, or, accepting
the truth, he may acknowledge his deed to be evil
and himself guilty.</p>

<p>Thus a gambler or a drunkard, who has succumbed to
his passion, is free to acknowledge gambling or drunkenness
either as evils, or as amusements without consequence.
In the first instance, if he cannot get rid of his
passion at once, he becomes free from it gradually, according
to the depth of his conviction of its evil. In
the second instance, his passion grows and gradually
deprives him of all chance of deliverance.</p>

<p>So, too, with a man who, unable to endure the scorching
flames for the rescue of his friend, himself escapes from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
a burning house, while he recognizes the truth that a
man should save the life of his fellow-man at the peril
of his own, is yet free to look upon his act as evil, and
therefore to condemn himself for it; or, denying this
truth, to judge his act to be both natural and necessary,
and so justify himself in his own opinion. In the first
instance, his recognition of the truth, even though he
has not acted in accordance with it, helps him to prepare
for a series of self-sacrificing actions that will inevitably
follow such recognition. In the second instance, he
prepares for a series of actions just as selfish.</p>

<p>I do not say that a man is always free to recognize or
not to recognize every truth. Certain truths there are,
long since recognized by men, and transmitted by tradition,
education, and mere force of habit until they have
become second nature; and there are other truths which
men perceive as but dimly and afar. A man is not free
not to recognize the first of these; he is not free to
recognize the second. But there is a third category of
truths, which have not as yet become unquestioned
motors of his activity, but have revealed themselves to
man so unmistakably that he is unable to disregard
them; he must inevitably consider them, and either
accept or reject them. It is by his relation to these
truths that a man's freedom is manifested.</p>

<p>Each man in his perception of truth is like a wayfarer
who walks by the aid of a lantern whose light he casts
before him: he does not see what as yet has not been
revealed by its beams, he does not see the path he has
left behind, merged again in the darkness; but at any
given point he sees that which the lantern reveals, and
he is always at liberty to choose one side of the road or
the other.</p>

<p>There exist for each man certain concealed truths, as
yet unrevealed to his mental vision; certain others,
which he has experienced, assimilated, and forgotten;
and yet others, that rise up before him demanding
immediate recognition from his reason. And it is in
the recognition or the disregard of these truths that
what we call freedom becomes evident.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>All the apparent difficulty of the question of man's
liberty comes from the fact that those who seek to solve
it represent man as stationary in the presence of the
truth.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly he is not free if we look upon him as a
stationary being; if we forget that the life of all humanity
is an eternal procession from darkness to light,
from the lower conception of truth to a higher one, from
truth mingled with error to purer truth.</p>

<p>A man would not be free if he were ignorant of all
truth; neither would he be free, nor even have any conception
of liberty, if the truth were suddenly revealed to
him in its entire purity and without any admixture of
error.</p>

<p>But man is not a stationary being. And as he advances
in life, every individual discovers an ever increasing
proportion of truth, and thus becomes less liable to
error.</p>

<p>The relations of man to truth are threefold. Some
truths are so familiar to him that they have become the
unconscious springs of action; others have only been
dimly revealed to him; again others, though still unfamiliar,
are revealed to him so plainly that they force
themselves upon his attention, and inevitably, in one
way or another, he is obliged to consider them. He
cannot ignore them, but must either recognize or repudiate
them.</p>

<p>And it is in the recognition or in the disregard of
these truths that man's free agency is manifested.</p>

<p>A man's freedom does not consist in a faculty of acting
independently of his environment and the various
influences it brings to bear upon his life, but in his
power to become, through recognizing and professing
the truth that has been revealed to him, a free and willing
laborer at the eternal and infinite work performed
by God and his universe; or, in shutting his eyes to
truth, to become a slave and be forced against his will
into a way in which he is loath to go.</p>

<p>Not only does truth point out the direction a man's
life <em>should</em> take, but it opens the only road he <em>can</em> take.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
Hence, all men will invariably, free or not, follow the
road of truth;&mdash;some willingly, doing the work they
have set themselves to do; others involuntarily, by submitting
in spite of themselves to the law of life. It is
in the power of choice that a man's freedom lies.</p>

<p>Freedom, in limits so narrow as these, appears to men
so insignificant that they fail to perceive it. The believers
in causation prefer to overlook it; the believers
in unlimited free will, keeping in view their own ideal,
disdain a freedom to them so insignificant. Freedom,
confined between the limits of entire ignorance of the
truth, or of the knowledge of only a part of it, does not
seem to them to be freedom, the more so that whether a
man is or is not willing to recognize the truth revealed
unto him, he will inevitably be forced to obey it in
life.</p>

<p>A horse harnessed to a load in company with other
horses is not free to remain in one place. If he does
not pull the load, the load will strike him and force him
to move in the direction it is going, thus compelling him
to advance. Still, in spite of this limitation of freedom,
the horse is still free to pull the load of his own accord,
or be pushed forward by it. The same reasoning can
be applied to human freedom.</p>

<p>Be this freedom great or small as compared with the
chimerical freedom for which we sigh, it is the only true
freedom, and through it alone is to be found all the happiness
accessible to man. And not only does this freedom
promote the happiness of men, but it is the only means
through which the work of the world can be accomplished.</p>

<p>According to the doctrine of Christ, a man who limits
his observation of life to the sphere in which there is no
freedom&mdash;to the sphere of effects&mdash;that is, of acts&mdash;does
not live a true life. He only lives a true life who
has transferred his life into the sphere in which freedom
lies,&mdash;into the domain of first causes,&mdash;that is to say,
by the recognition and practice of the truth revealed to
him.</p>

<p>The man who consecrates his life to sensual acts is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
ever performing acts that depend on temporary causes
beyond his control. Of himself he does nothing; it
only seems to him that he is acting independently,
whereas in reality all that he imagines he is doing by
himself is done through him by a superior force; he is
not the creator of life, but its slave. But the man who
devotes his life to the acknowledgment and practice of
the truth revealed to him unites himself with the source
of universal life, and accomplishes, not personal, individual
acts, that depend on the conditions of time and
space, but acts that have no causes, but are in themselves
causes of all else, and have an endless and unlimited
significance.</p>

<p>Because of their setting aside the essence of true life,
which consists in the recognition and practice of the
truth, and directing their efforts toward the improvement
of the external conditions of life, men of the
pagan life-conception may be likened to passengers on a
steamer, who should, in their anxiety to reach their destination,
extinguish the engine-fires, and instead of making
use of steam and screw, try during a storm to row
with oars which cannot reach the water.</p>

<p>The Kingdom of God is attained by effort, and it is
only those who make the effort that do attain it. It is
this effort, which consists in sacrificing outward conditions
for the sake of the truth, by which the Kingdom of
God is attained,&mdash;an effort which can and ought to be
made now, in our own epoch.</p>

<p>Men have but to understand this: that they must cease
to care for material and external matters, in which they
are not free; let them apply one hundredth part of the
energy now used by them in outward concerns to those
in which they are free,&mdash;to the recognition and profession
of the truth that confronts them, to the deliverance
of themselves and others from the falsehood and
hypocrisy which conceal the truth,&mdash;and then the false
system of life which now torments us, which threatens
us with still greater suffering, will be destroyed at once
without struggle. Then the Kingdom of Heaven, at
least in that first stage for which men through the development<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
of their consciousness are already prepared,
will be established.</p>

<p>As one shake is sufficient to precipitate into crystals
a liquid saturated with salt, so at the present time it may
be that only the least effort is needed in order that the
truth, already revealed to us, should spread among hundreds,
thousands, millions of men, and a public opinion
become established in conformity with the existing consciousness,
and the entire social organization become
transformed. It depends upon us to make this effort.</p>

<p>If only each of us would try to understand and recognize
the Christian truth, which in the most varied forms
surrounds us on all sides, pleading to be admitted into
our hearts; if we would cease to lie and pretend that we
do not see this truth, or that we are anxious to fulfil it,
excepting in the one thing that it really demands; if we
would only recognize this truth which calls us, and would
fearlessly profess it,&mdash;we should find forthwith that
hundreds, thousands, and millions of men are in the same
position as ourselves, fearing like ourselves to stand
alone in its recognition, and waiting only to hear its
avowal from others.</p>

<p>If men would only cease to be hypocrites they would
perceive at once that this cruel organization of society,
which alone hampers them and yet appears to them like
something immutable, necessary, and sacred, established
by God, is already wavering, and is maintained only by
the hypocrisy and the falsehood of ourselves and our
fellow-men.</p>

<p>But if it be true that it depends only on ourselves to
change the existing order of life, have we the right to
do it without knowing what we shall put in its place?
What will become of the world if the present system be
destroyed?</p>

<p>"What is there beyond the walls of the world we
leave behind us?</p>

<p>"Fear seizes us,&mdash;emptiness, space, freedom....&mdash;how
is one to go on, not knowing whither? How is one to
lose, without the hope of gain?...</p>

<p>"Had Columbus reasoned thus he never would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
weighed anchor. It was madness to attempt to cross
an unknown ocean, to set sail for a country whose very
existence was doubtful. But he discovered a new world
through this madness. To be sure, if people had only
to move from one furnished house into another and a
more commodious one, it would be an easy matter, but
the trouble lies in there being no one to prepare the new
apartments. The future looks more uncertain still than
the ocean,&mdash;it promises nothing,&mdash;it will only be what
men and circumstances make it.</p>

<p>"If you are content with the old world, try to preserve
it; it is sick, and will not live long. But if you can no
longer live in the eternal conflict between your convictions
and life, thinking one way and acting another, take
it upon yourselves to leave the shelter of the blanched
and ruinous arches of the Middle Ages. I am aware
that this is not an easy matter. It is hard to part with
all one has been accustomed to from birth. Men are
ready for great sacrifices, but not those which the new
life demands of them. Are they ready to sacrifice their
present civilization, their mode of life, their religion, their
conventional morality? Are they ready to be deprived
of all the results of such prolonged efforts, the results
we have boasted of for three centuries, of all the conveniences
and attractions of our existence, to give the
preference to wild youth rather than to civilized senility,
to pull down the palace built by our fathers simply for
the pleasure of laying the foundation of a new house,
which, without doubt, will not be completed till long after
our time."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Thus wrote, almost half a century ago, a
Russian author, who, with penetrating vision, clearly discerned
even at that time what is recognized by every
man to-day who reflects a little,&mdash;the impossibility of
continuing life on the former basis, and the necessity of
establishing some new mode of existence.</p>

<p>It is plain from the simplest and most ordinary point of
view that it is folly to remain under a roof that threatens
to fall, and that one must leave it. Indeed, it is difficult
to imagine a more miserable situation than that of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
present Christian world, with its nations arrayed in arms
one against the other, with its ever increasing taxes for
the purpose of supporting its growing armaments, with
the burning hatred of the working-classes for the rich,
with war suspended above all like the sword of Damocles
ready to fall, as it may, at any moment.</p>

<p>It is doubtful whether any revolution could be more
disastrous than the present social order, or rather disorder,
with its perpetual victims of overwork, misery,
drunkenness, dissipation, with all the horrors of impending
war that in one year will sacrifice more lives than
all the revolutions of the present century.</p>

<p>What will become of mankind if each one fulfils that
which God demands through the conscience that is in
him. Shall I be safe if, under the orders of my master,
I accomplish in his great workshop the tasks he has set
me, although, ignorant of his final plans, I may think it
strange? Nor is it alone the question of the future that
troubles men when they hesitate to do the master's
bidding. They are concerned about the question as
to how they are to live without the familiar conditions
which we call science, art, civilization, culture. We feel
individually all the burden of our present way of living;
we see that were this order of things to continue, it
would inevitably ruin us; and yet we are anxious to
have these conditions continue, to have our science, our
art, our civilization, and culture remain unchanged.
It is as though a man who dwells in an old house, suffering
from cold and discomfort, who is moreover aware
that its walls may tumble at any moment, should consent
to the remodeling of it, only on condition that he
may be allowed to remain there, a condition that is
equivalent to a refusal to have his dwelling rebuilt.
"What, if I should leave my house," he says, "I should
be temporarily deprived of its comforts; the new house
may not be built after all, or it may be constructed on a
new plan, which will lack the conveniences to which
I have been accustomed!" But if the materials and
the workmen are ready, it is probable that the new
house will be built, and in a better manner than the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
one; while it is not only probable but certain that the
old house will soon fall into ruins, crushing those who
remain within its walls. In order that the old, everyday
conditions of life may disappear and make room for
new and better ones, we must surely leave behind the
old conditions, which are at length become fatal and
impossible, and issue forth to meet the future.</p>

<p>"But science, art, civilization, and culture will cease
to be!" But if all these are only diverse manifestations
of truth, the impending change is to be accomplished
for the sake of a further advance toward truth
and its realization. "How, then, can the manifestations
of truth disappear, in consequence of further realization
of truth?" The manifestations of truth will be different,
better, loftier, the error that has been in them will
perish, while the verity that is in them will remain and
flourish with renewed vigor.</p>

<p>Return to yourselves, sons of men, and have faith in
the gospel, and in its doctrine of eternal happiness!
If you heed not this warning, you shall all perish like
the men slain by Pilate, like those upon whom the tower
of Siloam fell; like millions of other men, who slew
and were slain, who executed and suffered execution,
who tortured and were tortured; as perished the man
who so foolishly filled his granaries, counting on a long
life, on the very night when his soul was required of
him. Return, sons of men, and believe in the words
which Christ uttered 1800 years ago, words which He
repeats to-day with greater force, warning us that the
evil day He foretold is at hand, and that our life has
reached its last descent of folly and wickedness.</p>

<p>Now, after so many centuries of futile effort to protect
ourselves by the methods of the pagan system of
violence, it should be evident to every man that all such
effort, far from insuring our safety, tends only to add
a new element of danger both to individual and social
existence.</p>

<p>No matter by what names we may be called, nor what
garments we may wear, nor in the presence of what
priest we may be anointed, nor how many millions our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
subjects may number, nor how many guards may be
posted on our journey, nor how many policemen may
protect our property, nor how many so-called criminals,
revolutionists, or anarchists we may execute; no matter
what exploits we may perform, nor what states we
may establish, nor what fortresses and towers we may
erect, from the Tower of Babel to the Eiffel Tower,&mdash;we
have before us two ever present and unavoidable
conditions, that deprive our mode of life of all significance:
(1) death, that may overtake each of us at any
moment, and (2) the transitory nature of all our undertakings,
that disappear, leaving no trace behind them.
No matter what we may do, found kingdoms, build
palaces and monuments, write poems and songs,&mdash;all is
but fleeting and leaves no trace behind. Therefore no
matter how much we may attempt to conceal this from
ourselves, we cannot fail to perceive that the true significance
of our life lies neither in our individual, physical
existence, subjected to unavoidable suffering and death,
nor in any institution or social organization.</p>

<p>Whoever you are, you who read these lines, reflect
upon your position and your duties, not upon the position
of landowner, merchant, judge, emperor, president,
minister, priest, or soldier, which you may assume but
for a time, not upon the imaginary duties which these
positions impose upon you, but upon your actual and
eternal position as a being, who, after a whole eternity
of non-existence, is called by the will of Some One from
unconsciousness into life, and who may at any moment
return whence he came by the same will. Consider
your duties! Not your imaginary duties of landowner
in regard to your estate, nor of merchant to your capital,
nor of emperor, minister, or governor to the State,
but of your real duties, of a being called forth into life
and endowed with love and reason. Do that which He
who has sent you into this world, and to whom you will
shortly return, demands of you. Are you doing what
he requires? Are you doing right when, as landowner
or manufacturer, you take the products of the labor
of the poor, and establish your life on this spoliation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
or when, as governor or judge, you do violence in condemning
men to death; or when, as soldier, you prepare
for war, for fighting, robbery, and murder,&mdash;are you
doing right?</p>

<p>You say that the world is as you find it, that it is inevitable
that it should be as it is, that what you do you
are compelled to do. But can it be that, having so
strongly rooted an aversion to the suffering of men,
to violence, to murder; having such a need of loving
your fellow-men, and of being loved by them; seeing
clearly, too, that the greatest good possible to men
comes from acknowledging human brotherhood, from
one serving another: can it be that your heart tells
you all this, that you are taught it by your reason, that
science repeats it to you, and yet regardless of it, on the
strength of some mysterious and complicated argument,
you are forced to contradict it all in your daily conduct?
Is it possible that, being a landowner or a capitalist,
you should establish your life on the oppression of the
people; that, being an emperor or a president, you
should command armies, and be a leader of murderers;
that, being a functionary of State, you should take from
the poor their hard-earned money for your own benefit,
or for the benefit of the rich; that, being a judge or
juror, you should condemn erring men to torture and
death, because the truth has not been revealed to them;
or, above all, is it possible that you, a youth, should
enter the army, doing that upon which all the evil of the
world is founded, that, renouncing your own will, all
your human sympathy, you should engage at the will
of others to murder those whom they bid you murder?</p>

<p>It is impossible!</p>

<p>If you are told that all this is essential for the support
of the existing system of life; that this system,
with its pauperism, famine, prisons, executions, armies,
wars, is necessary for society, and that if it were to be
abolished worse evils would follow, you are told so only
by those who benefit by this system; while those who
suffer from it,&mdash;and their numbers are ten times greater,&mdash;all
think and say the opposite. And at the bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
of your heart you know that this is false,&mdash;that the
existing system has had its day, and must inevitably be
remodeled on new foundations; and that there is no
need whatsoever to support it by the sacrifice of human
life.</p>

<p>Even supposing that the existing system is necessary,
how is it that you should have to support it by trampling
upon all finer feelings? But who has made you
a guardian of this crumbling structure? Neither has
the State, nor society, nor has any one requested you
individually to support it by occupying your position of
landowner, merchant, emperor, priest, or soldier, and
you are well aware that you have accepted and are
holding it, not for purposes of self-denial, for the good
of your fellow-men, but for your own selfish interest;
for your greed of gain, vainglory, ambition, through
your indolence or your cowardice. If you do not desire
this position you should not persist in doing what is
cruel, false, and contemptible in order to retain it. If
you would once refrain from these things which you do
continually for the purpose of retaining it, you would
lose it at once. If you are a ruler or an official, make
only an attempt to cease polite lying, cease to take part
in violences and executions; if you are a priest, desist
from deceiving; if a soldier, cease killing; if a land-owner
or manufacturer, cease defending your property
by roguery and violence; and forthwith you will lose
the position which, as you say, is forced upon you and
seems to you burdensome.</p>

<p>It cannot be that a man should be placed against his
will in a position contrary to conscience.</p>

<p>If you are put in such a position, it is not because it
is necessary for some one to be there, but only because
you are willing to accept it. And therefore, knowing
that such a position is directly opposed to the mandates
of your heart, your reason, your faith, and even to the
teaching of that science you believe in, you cannot but
pause to consider, if you wish to keep it, and especially if
you try to justify it, if you are doing what you ought to do.</p>

<p>You might run the risk if you had but the time to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
your mistake and correct it, and if you ran the risk for
something worth having. But when you know for certain
that you are liable to die at any moment, without
the slightest possibility either for yourself or for those
whom you have drawn in with you of rectifying your
mistake; and, moreover, since you know that no matter
what those about you may accomplish in the material
organization of the world, it will all very shortly disappear
as certainly as you yourself, leaving no trace behind,&mdash;it
is surely obvious that you have no inducement
to run the risk of making a mistake so terrible.</p>

<p>This would seem perfectly plain and simple if we did
not veil with hypocrisy the truth that is indubitably
revealed to us.</p>

<p>Share what you have with others; do not amass
riches; be not vain; do not rob, torture, or murder
men; do not to others what you would not that others
should do to you,&mdash;these things have been said not
eighteen hundred but five thousand years ago, and
there can be no doubt of the truth of them. Save for
hypocrisy, it would be impossible, even if one did not
obey these rules, not to acknowledge that they ought to
be obeyed, and that those who do not obey them do
wrong.</p>

<p>But you say that there is still the general well-being,
for the sake of which one should deviate from these
rules. It is allowable for the general well-being to kill,
torture, and rob. "It is better that one man should
perish than a whole nation," you say, like Caiaphas,
when you are signing death-warrants; or you load your
gun to shoot your fellow-man, who is to perish for the
general good; or you imprison him or take away his
goods.</p>

<p>You say that you do these cruel things because you
are a part of society, of the State, and must serve your
government and carry out its laws, as landowner, judge,
emperor, or soldier. But if you are a part of the State
and have duties in consequence, you are also a partaker
of the infinite life of God's universe, and have higher
duties in consequence of that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>As your duties to your family or to society are always
subject to the higher duties that depend upon your citizenship
in the State, so your duties of citizenship are
subject to the duties arising from your relations to the
life of the universe, from your sonship to God. And as
it would be unwise to cut down telegraph poles in order
to furnish fuel for the benefit of a family or a few people,
because this would be breaking the laws that protect
the welfare of the State; so it is equally unwise,
in order to promote the welfare of the State, to execute
or murder a man, because this is breaking the immutable
laws which preserve the welfare of the world.</p>

<p>The obligations of citizenship must be subject to the
higher and eternal obligations on your part in the everlasting
life of God, and must not contradict them. As
it was said eighteen hundred years ago by the disciples
of Christ, "Whether it be right in the sight of God to
hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
"We ought to obey God rather than men."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>You are told to believe that in order to maintain an
ever changing system, established but yesterday by a
few men in a corner of the globe, you should commit
violent deeds that are against the fixed and eternal order
established by God or reason. Can it be possible?</p>

<p>Do not fail, then, to reflect upon your position of land-owner,
merchant, judge, emperor, president, minister,
priest, or soldier&mdash;associated with violence, oppression,
deceit, torture, and murder; refuse to recognize the
lawfulness of these crimes. I do not mean that if you
are a landowner you should forthwith give your land to
the poor; or if a capitalist, your money or your factory
to your workmen; or if a czar, a minister, a magistrate,
a judge, or a general, you should forthwith abdicate all
your advantages; or if a soldier, whose occupation in
its very nature is based on violence, you should at once
refuse to continue longer a soldier, despite all the
dangers of such a refusal. Should you do this, it will
indeed be an heroic act; but it may happen&mdash;and most
probably&mdash;that you will not be able to do it. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
have connections, a family, subordinates, chiefs; you
may be surrounded by temptations so strong that you
cannot overcome them; but to acknowledge the truth to
be the truth, and not to lie&mdash;that you are always able to
do. You can refrain from affirming that you continue
to be a landowner or factory-owner, a merchant, an artist,
an author, because you are thus useful to men; from
declaring that you are a governor, an attorney-general,
a czar, not because it is agreeable or you are accustomed
to be such, but for the good of men; from saying that
you remain a soldier, not through fear of punishment,
but because you consider the army indispensable for
the protection of men's lives. To keep from speaking
thus falsely before yourself and others&mdash;this you are
always able to do, and not only able, but in duty bound
to do, because in this alone&mdash;in freeing yourself from
falsehood and in working out the truth&mdash;lies the highest
duty of your life. And do but this and it will be
sufficient for the situation to change at once of itself.</p>

<p>One only thing in which you are free and all-powerful
has been given you; all others are beyond you. It
is this,&mdash;to know the truth and to profess it. And it
is only because of other miserable and erring men like
yourself that you have become a soldier, an emperor, a
landowner, a capitalist, a priest, or a general; that you
commit evil deeds so obviously contrary to the dictates
of your heart and reason; that you torture, rob, and
murder men, establishing your life on their sufferings;
and that, above all, instead of performing your paramount
duty of acknowledging and professing the truth
which is known to you, you pretend not to know it, concealing
it from yourself and others, doing the very opposite
of what you have been called to do.</p>

<p>And under what conditions are you doing this? Being
liable to die at any moment, you sign a death-warrant,
declare war or take part in it, pass judgment, torture
and rob workmen, live in luxury surrounded by misery,
and teach weak and trusting men that all this is right
and for you is a matter of duty, while all the time you
are in danger of your life being destroyed by a bullet or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
a bacillus, and you may be deprived forever of the power
to rectify or counteract the evil you have done to others
and to yourself; having wasted a life given you but once
in all eternity, having left undone in it the one thing for
which it was given you.</p>

<p>No matter how trite it may appear to state it, nor how
we may hypocritically deceive ourselves, nothing can destroy
the certainty of the simple and obvious truth that
external conditions can never render safe this life of
ours, so fraught with unavoidable suffering, and ended
infallibly by death, that human life can have no other
meaning than the constant fulfilment of that for which
the Almighty Power has sent us here, and for which He
has given us one sure guide in this life, namely, our
conscious reason.</p>

<p>This Power does not require from us what is unreasonable
and impossible,&mdash;the organization of our temporal,
material life, the life of society, or of the State. He
demands of us only what is reasonable and possible,&mdash;to
serve the Kingdom of God, which establishes the
unity of mankind, a unity possible only in the truth;
to recognize and profess the truth revealed to us, which
it is always in our power to do.</p>

<p>"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness;
and all these things shall be added unto you."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>The only significance of life consists in helping to
establish the Kingdom of God; and this can be done
only by means of the acknowledgment and profession
of the truth by each one of us. "The kingdom of God
cometh not with observation: neither shall they say, Lo
here! or, lo there! for, behold the kingdom of God is
within you."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<h2>WHAT IS ART?</h2>


<hr class="tb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>
<h2>TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE</h2>


<p>The fundamental thought expressed in this book
leads inevitably to conclusions so new, so unexpected,
and so contrary to what is usually maintained in
literary and artistic circles, that although it is clearly
and emphatically expressed (and this I hope has not
been lost in translation), most readers who wish to possess
themselves of it will have to read the work carefully,
and to digest it slowly.</p>

<p>Especially the introductory Chapters II., III., IV., and
V., need careful perusal by any who, having adopted
one or other of the current theories on beauty and art,
may find it difficult to abandon a preconceived view,
and to clear their minds for a fair appreciation of what
is new to them.</p>

<p>The first four chapters raise the problem, and tell us
briefly what has been said by previous writers. Chapter
III. gives (in highly condensed form) the substance
of the teaching of some sixty philosophers on this subject,
and since many of them were extremely confused,
the chapter cannot, in the nature of things, be easy
reading.</p>

<p>I should like to remark, in passing, that though Tolstoï
in this chapter (presumably for convenience of verification)
refers chiefly to the compilations of Schasler,
Kralik, and Knight, he has gone behind these authorities
to the primary sources. To give a single instance:
in the paragraph on Darwin, the foot-note refers us to
Knight, but the remark that the origin of the art of
music may be traced back to the call of the males to
the females in the animal world will be found in Darwin,
but will not be found in Knight.</p>

<p>In Chapter V. we come to Tolstoï's definition of art,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
which definition should be kept well in mind while reading
the rest of the book.</p>

<p>No doubt most of those to whom it is an end in itself,
who live by it, or make it their chief occupation, will
read this book (or leave it unread) and go on in their
former way, much as Pharaoh, of old, hardened his
heart, and did not sympathize with what Moses had to
say on the labor question. But for those of us who
have felt that art is too valuable a matter to be lost out
of our lives, and who, in their quest for social justice,
have met the reproach that they were sacrificing the
pleasures and advantages of art, this book is of inestimable
value, in that it solves a perplexed question of
far-reaching importance to practical life.</p>

<p>To this class of readers neither the masterly elucidation
of the former theories contained in the opening
chapters, nor the explanation of how it has come about
that such great importance is attached to the activity we
call art (Chapters VI. and VII.), nor the explanation
and illustrations of the perversion that art has undergone,
nor even the elucidation of the terrible evils this
perversion is producing (XVII.), will equal in significance
the remaining chapters of the book. These show us
what to look for in art, how to distinguish it from counterfeits
(XV., XVI., and XVIII.), treat of the true art
of the future (XIX.), and explain how science and art
are linked together in man's life, are directed by his
perception of the meaning of life, and inevitably react
on all he thinks and feels.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_AUTHORS_PREFACE" id="THE_AUTHORS_PREFACE">THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>This book of mine, "What is Art?" appears now
for the first time in its true form. More than one
edition has already been issued in Russia, but in each
case it has been so mutilated by the "Censor," that I
request all who are interested in my views on art only
to judge of them by the work in its present shape. The
causes which led to the publication of the book&mdash;with
my name attached to it&mdash;in a mutilated form were the
following: In accordance with a decision I arrived at
long ago,&mdash;not to submit my writings to the "Censorship"
(which I consider to be an immoral and irrational
institution), but to print them only in the shape in which
they were written,&mdash;I intended not to attempt to print
this work in Russia. However, my good acquaintance,
Professor Grote, editor of a Moscow psychological magazine,
having heard of the contents of my work, asked me
to print it in his magazine, and promised me that he
would get the book through the "Censor's" office unmutilated
if I would but agree to a few very unimportant
alterations, merely toning down certain expressions. I
was weak enough to agree to this, and it has resulted in
a book appearing under my name, from which not only
have some essential thoughts been excluded, but into
which the thoughts of other men&mdash;even thoughts utterly
opposed to my own convictions&mdash;have been introduced.</p>

<p>The thing occurred in this way. First, Grote softened
my expressions, and in some cases weakened them. For
instance, he replaced the words: <em>always</em> by <em>sometimes</em>,
<em>all</em> by <em>some</em>, <em>Church</em> religion by <em>Roman Catholic</em> religion,
"<em>Mother of God</em>" by <em>Madonna</em>, <em>patriotism</em> by <em>pseudo-patriotism</em>,
<em>palaces</em> by <em>palatii</em>,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> etc., and I did not consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
it necessary to protest. But when the book was already
in type, the Censor required that whole sentences should
be altered, and that instead of what I said about the evil
of landed property, a remark should be substituted on
the evils of a landless proletariate.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> I agreed to this
also, and to some further alterations. It seemed not
worth while to upset the whole affair for the sake of
one sentence, and when one alteration had been agreed
to it seemed not worth while to protest against a second
and a third. So, little by little, expressions crept into
the book which altered the sense and attributed things
to me that I could not have wished to say. So that by
the time the book was printed it had been deprived of
some part of its integrity and sincerity. But there was
consolation in the thought that the book, even in this
form, if it contains something that is good, would be of
use to Russian readers whom it would otherwise not have
reached. Things, however, turned out otherwise. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nous
comptions sans notre hôte.</i> After the legal term of four
days had already elapsed, the book was seized, and, on
instructions received from Petersburg, it was handed
over to the "Spiritual Censor." Then Grote declined
all further participation in the affair, and the "Spiritual
Censor" proceeded to do what he would with the book.
The "Spiritual Censorship" is one of the most ignorant,
venal, stupid, and despotic institutions in Russia. Books
which disagree in any way with the recognized state religion
of Russia, if once it gets hold of them, are almost
always totally suppressed and burnt; which is what
happened to all my religious works when attempts were
made to print them in Russia. Probably a similar fate
would have overtaken this work also, had not the editors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
of the magazine employed all means to save it. The result
of their efforts was that the "Spiritual Censor," a
priest who probably understands art and is interested in
art as much as I understand or am interested in church
services, but who gets a good salary for destroying whatever
is likely to displease his superiors, struck out all that
seemed to him to endanger his position, and substituted
his thoughts for mine wherever he considered it necessary
to do so. For instance, where I speak of Christ
going to the Cross for the sake of the truth He professed,
the "Censor" substituted a statement that Christ died
for mankind, <em>i.e</em>. he attributed to me an assertion of the
dogma of the Redemption, which I consider to be one of
the most untrue and harmful of Church dogmas. After
correcting the book in this way, the "Spiritual Censor"
allowed it to be printed.</p>

<p>To protest in Russia is impossible&mdash;no newspaper
would publish such a protest; and to withdraw my book
from the magazine, and place the editor in an awkward
position with the public, was also not possible.</p>

<p>So the matter has remained. A book has appeared
under my name containing thoughts attributed to me
which are not mine.</p>

<p>I was persuaded to give my article to a Russian magazine
in order that my thoughts, which may be useful,
should become the possession of Russian readers; and
the result has been that my name is affixed to a work
from which it might be assumed that I quite arbitrarily
assert things contrary to the general opinion, without
adducing my reasons; that I only consider false patriotism
bad, but patriotism in general a very good feeling;
that I merely deny the absurdities of the Roman Catholic
Church and disbelieve in the Madonna, but that I believe
in the Orthodox Eastern faith and in the "Mother of
God"; that I consider all the writings collected in the
Bible to be holy books, and see the chief importance
of Christ's life in the Redemption of mankind by His
death.</p>

<p>I have narrated all this in such detail because it strikingly
illustrates the indubitable truth that all compromise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
with institutions of which your conscience disapproves,&mdash;compromises
which are usually made for the sake of
the general good,&mdash;instead of producing the good you
expected, inevitably lead you, not only to acknowledge
the institution you disapprove of, but also to participate
in the evil that institution produces.</p>

<p>I am glad to be able by this statement at least to do
something to correct the error into which I was led by
my compromise.</p>

<p>I have also to mention that besides reinstating the
parts excluded by the Censor from the Russian editions,
other corrections and additions of importance have been
made in this edition.</p>

<h2>WHAT IS ART?</h2>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>


<p>Take up any one of our ordinary newspapers, and
you will find a part devoted to the theater and
music. In almost every number you will find a description
of some art exhibition, or of some particular picture,
and you will always find reviews of new works of art that
have appeared, of volumes of poems, of short stories, or
of novels.</p>

<p>Promptly, and in detail, as soon as it has occurred, an
account is published of how such and such an actress
or actor played this or that rôle in such and such a drama,
comedy, or opera; and of the merits of the performance,
as well as of the contents of the new drama, comedy, or
opera, with its defects and merits. With as much care
and detail, or even more, we are told how such and such
an artist has sung a certain piece, or has played it on the
piano or violin, and what were the merits and defects of
the piece and of the performance. In every large town
there is sure to be at least one, if not more than one,
exhibition of new pictures, the merits and defects of
which are discussed in the utmost detail by critics and
connoisseurs.</p>

<p>New novels and poems, in separate volumes or in the
magazines, appear almost every day, and the newspapers
consider it their duty to give their readers detailed
accounts of these artistic productions.</p>

<p>For the support of art in Russia (where for the education
of the people only a hundredth part is spent of what
would be required to give every one the opportunity of
instruction) the government grants millions of roubles in
subsidies to academies, conservatoires, and theaters. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
France twenty million francs are assigned for art, and
similar grants are made in Germany and England.</p>

<p>In every large town enormous buildings are erected for
museums, academies, conservatoires, dramatic schools,
and for performances and concerts. Hundreds of thousands
of workmen&mdash;carpenters, masons, painters, joiners,
paperhangers, tailors, hairdressers, jewelers, molders,
type-setters&mdash;spend their whole lives in hard labor to
satisfy the demands of art, so that hardly any other department
of human activity, except the military, consumes
so much energy as this.</p>

<p>Not only is enormous labor spent on this activity, but
in it, as in war, the very lives of men are sacrificed.
Hundreds of thousands of people devote their lives from
childhood to learning to twirl their legs rapidly (dancers),
or to touch notes and strings very rapidly (musicians),
or to draw with paint and represent what they see (artists),
or to turn every phrase inside out and find a rhyme
to every word. And these people, often very kind and
clever, and capable of all sorts of useful labor, grow savage
over their specialized and stupefying occupations,
and become one-sided and self-complacent specialists,
dull to all the serious phenomena of life, and skilful only
at rapidly twisting their legs, their tongues, or their
fingers.</p>

<p>But even this stunting of human life is not the worst.
I remember being once at the rehearsal of one of the
most ordinary of the new operas which are produced at
all the opera houses of Europe and America.</p>

<p>I arrived when the first act had already commenced.
To reach the auditorium I had to pass through the stage
entrance. By dark entrances and passages, I was led
through the vaults of an enormous building, past immense
machines for changing the scenery and for illuminating;
and there in the gloom and dust I saw workmen busily
engaged. One of these men, pale, haggard, in a dirty
blouse, with dirty, work-worn hands and cramped fingers,
evidently tired and out of humor, went past me,
angrily scolding another man. Ascending by a dark
stair, I came out on the boards behind the scenes. Amid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
various poles and rings and scattered scenery, decorations
and curtains, stood and moved dozens, if not hundreds,
of painted and dressed-up men, in costumes fitting
tight to their thighs and calves, and also women, as usual,
as nearly nude as might be. These were all singers, or
members of the chorus, or ballet-dancers, awaiting their
turns. My guide led me across the stage and, by means
of a bridge of boards across the orchestra (in which perhaps
a hundred musicians of all kinds, from kettledrum
to flute and harp, were seated), to the dark pit-stalls.</p>

<p>On an elevation, between two lamps with reflectors,
and in an arm-chair placed before a music-stand, sat the
director of the musical part, <em>bâton</em> in hand, managing
the orchestra and singers, and, in general, the production
of the whole opera.</p>

<p>The performance had already commenced, and on the
stage a procession of Indians who had brought home a
bride was being presented. Besides men and women in
costume, two other men in ordinary clothes bustled and
ran about on the stage; one was the director of the dramatic
part, and the other, who stepped about in soft
shoes and ran from place to place with unusual agility,
was the dancing-master, whose salary per month exceeded
what ten laborers earn in a year.</p>

<p>These three directors arranged the singing, the orchestra,
and the procession. The procession, as usual,
was enacted by couples, with tinfoil halberds on their
shoulders. They all came from one place, and walked
round and round again, and then stopped. The procession
took a long time to arrange: first the Indians with
halberds came on too late; then too soon; then at the
right time, but crowded together at the exit; then they
did not crowd, but arranged themselves badly at the sides
of the stage; and each time the whole performance was
stopped and recommenced from the beginning. The
procession was introduced by a recitative, delivered by
a man dressed up like some variety of Turk, who, opening
his mouth in a curious way, sang, "Home I bring
the bri-i-ide." He sings and waves his arm (which is of
course bare) from under his mantle. The procession commences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
but here the French horn, in the accompaniment
of the recitative, does something wrong; and the director,
with a shudder as if some catastrophe had occurred, raps
with his stick on the stand. All is stopped, and the director,
turning to the orchestra, attacks the French horn,
scolding him in the rudest terms, as cabmen abuse each
other, for taking the wrong note. And again the whole
thing recommences. The Indians with their halberds
again come on, treading softly in their extraordinary
boots; again the singer sings, "Home I bring the
bri-i-ide." But here the pairs get too close together.
More raps with the stick, more scolding, and a recommencement.
Again, "Home I bring the bri-i-ide," again
the same gesticulation with the bare arm from under the
mantle, and again the couples, treading softly with halberds
on their shoulders, some with sad and serious faces,
some talking and smiling, arrange themselves in a circle
and begin to sing. All seems to be going well, but again
the stick raps, and the director, in a distressed and angry
voice, begins to scold the men and women of the
chorus. It appears that when singing they had omitted
to raise their hands from time to time in sign of animation.
"Are you all dead, or what? Cows that you are!
Are you corpses, that you can't move?" Again they
recommence, "Home I bring the bri-i-ide," and again,
with sorrowful faces, the chorus-women sing, first one
and then another of them raising their hands. But two
chorus-girls speak to each other,&mdash;again a more vehement
rapping with the stick. "Have you come here to
talk? Can't you gossip at home? You there in red
breeches, come nearer. Look toward me! Recommence!"
Again, "Home I bring the bri-i-ide." And
so it goes on for one, two, three hours. The whole of
such a rehearsal lasts six hours on end. Raps with the
stick, repetitions, placings, corrections of the singers, of
the orchestra, of the procession, of the dancers,&mdash;all
seasoned with angry scolding. I heard the words,
"asses," "fools," "idiots," "swine," addressed to the
musicians and singers at least forty times in the course
of one hour. And the unhappy individual to whom the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
abuse is addressed,&mdash;flautist, horn-blower, or singer,&mdash;physically
and mentally demoralized, does not reply, and
does what is demanded of him. Twenty times is repeated
the one phrase, "Home I bring the bri-i-ide," and twenty
times the striding about in yellow shoes with a halberd
over the shoulder. The conductor knows that these people
are so demoralized that they are no longer fit for anything
but to blow trumpets and walk about with halberds
and in yellow shoes, and that they are also accustomed
to dainty, easy living, so that they will put up with anything
rather than lose their luxurious life. He therefore
gives free vent to his churlishness, especially as he has
seen the same thing done in Paris and Vienna, and
knows that this is the way the best conductors behave,
and that it is a musical tradition of great artists to be
so carried away by the great business of their art that
they cannot pause to consider the feelings of other
artists.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to find a more repulsive sight.
I have seen one workman abuse another for not supporting
the weight piled upon him when goods were
being unloaded, or, at hay-stacking, the village elder
scold a peasant for not making the rick right, and the
man submitted in silence. And, however unpleasant
it was to witness the scene, the unpleasantness was
lessened by the consciousness that the business in
hand was needful and important, and that the fault
for which the head man scolded the laborer was one
which might spoil a needful undertaking.</p>

<p>But what was being done here? For what, and for
whom? Very likely the conductor was tired out, like
the workman I passed in the vaults; it was even
evident that he was; but who made him tire himself?
And for what was he tiring himself? The opera he
was rehearsing was one of the most ordinary of operas
for people who are accustomed to them, but also one
of the most gigantic absurdities that could possibly
be devised. An Indian king wants to marry; they
bring him a bride; he disguises himself as a minstrel;
the bride falls in love with the minstrel and is in despair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
but afterwards discovers that the minstrel is the
king, and every one is highly delighted.</p>

<p>That there never were, or could be, such Indians,
and that they were not only unlike Indians, but that
what they were doing was unlike anything on earth
except other operas, was beyond all manner of doubt;
that people do not converse in such a way as recitative,
and do not place themselves at fixed distances,
in a quartet, waving their arms to express their
emotions; that nowhere, except in theaters, do people
walk about in such a manner, in pairs, with tinfoil
halberds and in slippers; that no one ever gets angry
in such a way, or is affected in such a way, or laughs
in such a way, or cries in such a way; and that no one
on earth can be moved by such performances; all this
is beyond the possibility of doubt.</p>

<p>Instinctively the question presents itself: For whom
is this being done? Whom <em>can</em> it please? If there
are, occasionally, good melodies in the opera, to which
it is pleasant to listen, they could have been sung
simply, without these stupid costumes and all the processions
and recitatives and hand-wavings.</p>

<p>The ballet, in which half-naked women make voluptuous
movements, twisting themselves into various sensual
wreathings, is simply a lewd performance.</p>

<p>So one is quite at a loss as to whom these things
are done for. The man of culture is heartily sick of
them, while to a real working-man they are utterly incomprehensible.
If any one can be pleased by these
things (which is doubtful), it can only be some young
footman or depraved artisan, who has contracted the
spirit of the upper classes but is not yet satiated with
their amusements, and wishes to show his breeding.</p>

<p>And all this nasty folly is prepared, not simply, nor
with kindly merriment, but with anger and brutal
cruelty.</p>

<p>It is said that it is all done for the sake of art, and
that art is a very important thing. But is it true that
art is so important that such sacrifices should be made
for its sake? This question is especially urgent, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
art, for the sake of which the labor of millions,
the lives of men, and, above all, love between man and
man, are being sacrificed,&mdash;this very art is becoming
something more and more vague and uncertain to
human perception.</p>

<p>Criticism, in which the lovers of art used to find
support for their opinions, has latterly become so self-contradictory,
that, if we exclude from the domain of
art all that to which the critics of various schools themselves
deny the title, there is scarcely any art left.</p>

<p>The artists of various sects, like the theologians of
the various sects, mutually exclude and destroy themselves.
Listen to the artists of the schools of our
times, and you will find, in all branches, each set of
artists disowning others. In poetry the old romanticists
deny the parnassiens and the decadents; the
parnassiens disown the romanticists and the decadents;
the decadents disown all their predecessors and
the symbolists; the symbolists disown all their predecessors
and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les mages</i>; and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les mages</i> disown all,
all their predecessors. Among novelists we have
naturalists, psychologists, and "nature-ists," all rejecting
each other. And it is the same in dramatic art,
in painting, and in music. So that art, which demands
such tremendous labor-sacrifices from the people,
which stunts human lives and transgresses against
human love, is not only <em>not</em> a thing clearly and firmly
defined, but is understood in such contradictory ways
by its own devotees that it is difficult to say what is
meant by art, and especially what is good, useful art,&mdash;art
for the sake of which we might condone such
sacrifices as are being offered at its shrine.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>


<p>For the production of every ballet, circus, opera,
operetta, exhibition, picture, concert, or printed book,
the intense and unwilling labor of thousands and thousands
of people is needed at what is often harmful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
humiliating work. It were well if artists made all they
require for themselves, but, as it is, they all need the
help of workmen, not only to produce art, but also for
their own usually luxurious maintenance. And, one
way or other, they get it; either through payments from
rich people, or through subsidies given by government
(in Russia, for instance, in grants of millions of roubles
to theaters, conservatoires, and academies). This money
is collected from the people, some of whom have to sell
their only cow to pay the tax, and who never get those
æsthetic pleasures which art gives.</p>

<p>It was all very well for a Greek or Roman artist, or
even for a Russian artist of the first half of our century
(when there were still slaves, and it was considered right
that there should be), with a quiet mind to make people
serve him and his art; but in our day, when in all men
there is at least some dim perception of the equal rights
of all, it is impossible to constrain people to labor unwillingly
for art, without first deciding the question
whether it is true that art is so good and so important
an affair as to redeem this evil.</p>

<p>If not, we have the terrible probability to consider,
that while fearful sacrifices of the labor and lives of men,
and of morality itself, are being made to art, that same
art may be not only useless but even harmful.</p>

<p>And therefore it is necessary for a society in which
works of art arise and are supported, to find out whether
all that professes to be art is really art; whether (as is
presupposed in our society) all that which is art is good;
and whether it is important and worth those sacrifices
which it necessitates. It is still more necessary for
every conscientious artist to know this, that he may be
sure that all he does has a valid meaning; that it is not
merely an infatuation of the small circle of people among
whom he lives which excites in him the false assurance
that he is doing a good work; and that what he takes
from others for the support of his often very luxurious
life, will be compensated for by those productions at
which he works. And that is why answers to the above
questions are especially important in our time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>What is this art, which is considered so important and
necessary for humanity that for its sake these sacrifices of
labor, of human life, and even of goodness may be made?</p>

<p>"What is art? What a question! Art is architecture,
sculpture, painting, music, and poetry in all its forms,"
usually replies the ordinary man, the art amateur, or
even the artist himself, imagining the matter about
which he is talking to be perfectly clear, and uniformly
understood by everybody. But in architecture, one inquires
further, are there not simple buildings which are
not objects of art, and buildings with artistic pretensions
which are unsuccessful and ugly and therefore cannot
be considered as works of art? Wherein lies the characteristic
sign of a work of art?</p>

<p>It is the same in sculpture, in music, and in poetry.
Art, in all its forms, is bounded on one side by the practically
useful, and on the other by unsuccessful attempts
at art. How is art to be marked off from each of these?
The ordinary educated man of our circle, and even the
artist who has not occupied himself especially with
æsthetics, will not hesitate at this question either. He
thinks the solution has been found long ago, and is well
known to every one.</p>

<p>"Art is such activity as produces beauty," says such
a man.</p>

<p>If art consists in that, then is a ballet or an operetta
art? you inquire.</p>

<p>"Yes," says the ordinary man, though with some hesitation,
"a good ballet or a graceful operetta is also art,
in so far as it manifests beauty."</p>

<p>But without even asking the ordinary man what differentiates
the "good" ballet and the "graceful" operetta
from their opposites (a question he would have much
difficulty in answering), if you ask him whether the
activity of costumiers and hairdressers, who ornament
the figures and faces of the women for the ballet and
the operetta, is art; or the activity of Worth, the dressmaker;
of scent-makers and men cooks,&mdash;then he will,
in most cases, deny that their activity belongs to the
sphere of art. But in this the ordinary man makes a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
mistake, just because he is an ordinary man and not a
specialist, and because he has not occupied himself with
æsthetic questions. Had he looked into these matters,
he would have seen in the great Renan's book, "Marc
Aurele," a dissertation showing that the tailor's work is
art, and that those who do not see in the adornment of
woman an affair of the highest art are very small-minded
and dull. "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C'est le grand art</i>," says Renan. Moreover,
he would have known that in many æsthetic systems&mdash;for
instance, in the æsthetics of the learned Professor
Kralik, "Weltschönheit, Versuch einer allgemeinen Æsthetik,
von Richard Kralik," and in "Les Problèmes de
l'Esthétique Contemporaine," by Guyau&mdash;the arts of
costume, of taste, and of touch are included.</p>

<p>"<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Es Folgt nun ein Fünfblatt von Künsten, die der subjectiven
Sinnlichkeit entkeimen</i>" (There results then a
pentafoliate of arts, growing out of the subjective perceptions),
says Kralik (p. 175). "<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Sie sind die ästhetische
Behandlung der fünf Sinne.</i>" (They are the æsthetic
treatment of the five senses.)</p>

<p>These five arts are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p><i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Kunst des Geschmacksinns</i>&mdash;The art of the sense
of taste (p. 175).</p>

<p><i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Kunst des Geruchsinns</i>&mdash;The art of the sense
of smell (p. 177).</p>

<p><i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Kunst des Tastsinns</i>&mdash;The art of the sense of
touch (p. 180).</p>

<p><i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Kunst des Gehörsinns</i>&mdash;The art of the sense of
hearing (p. 182).</p>

<p><i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Kunst des Gesichtsinns</i>&mdash;The art of the sense
of sight (p. 184).</p>

<p>Of the first of these&mdash;<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">die Kunst des Geschmacksinns</i>&mdash;he
says: "<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Man hält zwar gewöhnlich nur zwei oder
höchstens drei Sinne für würdig, den Stoff künstlerischer
Behandlung abzugeben, aber ich glaube nur mit bedingtem
Recht. Ich will kein allzugrosses Gewicht darauf legen,
dass der gemeine Sprachgebrauch manch andere Künste,
wie zum Beispiel die Kochkunst kennt.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>
<p>And further: "<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Und es ist doch gewiss eine ästhetische
Leistung, wenn es der Kochkunst gelingt ans einem thierischen
Kadaver einen Gegenstand des Geschmacks in
jedem Sinne zu machen. Der Grundsatz der Kunst des
Geschmacksinns (die weiter ist als die sogenannte Kochkunst)
ist also dieser: Es soll alles Geniessbare als Sinnbild
einer Idee behandelt werden und in jedesmaligem
Einklang zur auszudrückenden Idee.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>This author, like Renan, acknowledges a <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kostümkunst</i>
(Art of Costume) (p. 200), etc.</p>

<p>Such is also the opinion of the French writer, Guyau,
who is highly esteemed by some authors of our day. In his
book, "Les Problèmes de l'Esthétique Contemporaine,"
he speaks seriously of touch, taste, and smell as giving,
or being capable of giving, æsthetic impressions: "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Si la
couleur manque au toucher, il nous fournit en revanche
une notion que l'&oelig;il seul ne peut nous donner, et qui a une
valeur esthétique considérable, celle du</i> doux, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">du</i> soyeux,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">du</i> poli. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ce qui caractérise la beauté du velours, c'est sa
douceur au toucher non moins que son brillant. Dans
l'idée que nous nous faisons de la beauté d'une femme, le
velouté de sa peau entre comme élément essentiel.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chacun de nous probablement avec un peu d'attention
se rappellera des jouissances du goût, qui ont été de véritables
jouissances esthétiques.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> And he recounts how a
glass of milk drunk by him in the mountains gave him
æsthetic enjoyment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>
<p>So it turns out that the conception of art, as consisting
in making beauty manifest, is not at all so simple as
it seemed, especially now, when in this conception of
beauty are included our sensations of touch and taste
and smell, as they are by the latest æsthetic writers.</p>

<p>But the ordinary man either does not know, or does not
wish to know, all this, and is firmly convinced that all
questions about art may be simply and clearly solved by
acknowledging beauty to be the subject-matter of art. To
him it seems clear and comprehensible that art consists
in manifesting beauty, and that a reference to beauty
will serve to explain all questions about art.</p>

<p>But what is this beauty which forms the subject-matter
of art? How is it defined? What is it?</p>

<p>As is always the case, the more cloudy and confused
the conception conveyed by a word, with the more
<em>aplomb</em> and self-assurance do people use that word, pretending
that what is understood by it is so simple and
clear that it is not worth while even to discuss what it
actually means.</p>

<p>This is how matters of orthodox religion are usually
dealt with, and this is how people now deal with the
conception of beauty. It is taken for granted that what
is meant by the word beauty is known and understood
by every one. And yet not only is this not known, but,
after whole mountains of books have been written on the
subject by the most learned and profound thinkers during
one hundred and fifty years (ever since Baumgarten
founded æsthetics in the year 1750), the question, What
is beauty? remains to this day quite unsolved, and in
each new work on æsthetics it is answered in a new
way. One of the last books I read on æsthetics is a
not ill-written booklet by Julius Mithalter, called "Rätsel
des Schönen" (The Enigma of the Beautiful). And that
title precisely expresses the position of the question,
What is beauty? After thousands of learned men have
discussed it during one hundred and fifty years, the
meaning of the word beauty remains an enigma still.
The Germans answer the question in their manner,
though in a hundred different ways. The physiologist-æstheticians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
especially the Englishmen, Herbert Spencer,
Grant Allen, and his school, answer it, each in his own
way; the French eclectics, and the followers of Guyau
and Taine, also each in his own way; and all these
people know all the preceding solutions given by
Baumgarten, and Kant, and Schelling, and Schiller, and
Fichte, and Winckelmann, and Lessing, and Hegel, and
Schopenhauer, and Hartmann, and Schasler, and Cousin,
and Lévêque, and others.</p>

<p>What is this strange conception "beauty," which
seems so simple to those who talk without thinking,
but in defining which all the philosophers of various
tendencies and different nationalities can come to no
agreement during a century and a half? What is this
conception of beauty, on which the dominant doctrine of
art rests?</p>

<p>In Russian, by the word <i lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">krasota</i> (beauty) we mean only
that which pleases the sight. And though latterly people
have begun to speak of "an ugly deed," or of "beautiful
music," it is not good Russian.</p>

<p>A Russian of the common folk, not knowing foreign
languages, will not understand you if you tell him that a
man who has given his last coat to another, or done anything
similar, has acted "beautifully," that a man who
has cheated another has done an "ugly" action, or that
a song is "beautiful."</p>

<p>In Russian a deed may be kind and good, or unkind
and bad. Music may be pleasant and good, or unpleasant
and bad; but there can be no such thing as
"beautiful" or "ugly" music.</p>

<p>Beautiful may relate to a man, a horse, a house, a
view, or a movement. Of actions, thoughts, character,
or music, if they please us, we may say that they are
good, or, if they do not please us, that they are not
good. But beautiful can be used only concerning that
which pleases the sight. So that the word and conception
"good" includes the conception of "beautiful," but
the reverse is not the case; the conception "beauty"
does not include the conception "good." If we say
"good" of an article which we value for its appearance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
we thereby say that the article is beautiful; but if we say it
is "beautiful," it does not at all mean that the article is
a good one.</p>

<p>Such is the meaning ascribed by the Russian language,
and therefore by the sense of the people, to the words
and conceptions "good" and "beautiful."</p>

<p>In all the European languages, <em>i.e.</em> the languages
of those nations among whom the doctrine has spread
that beauty is the essential thing in art, the words
"beau," "schön," "beautiful," "bello," etc., while keeping
their meaning of beautiful in form, have come to
also express "goodness," "kindness," <em>i.e.</em> have come
to act as substitutes for the word "good."</p>

<p>So that it has become quite natural in those languages
to use such expressions as "belle ame," "schöne Gedanken,"
of "beautiful deed." Those languages no
longer have a suitable word wherewith expressly to
indicate beauty of form, and have to use a combination
of words such as "beau par la forme," "beautiful to
look at," etc., to convey that idea.</p>

<p>Observation of the divergent meanings which the
words "beauty" and "beautiful" have in Russian on
the one hand, and in those European languages now
permeated by this æsthetic theory on the other hand,
shows us that the word "beauty" has, among the latter,
acquired a special meaning, namely, that of "good."</p>

<p>What is remarkable, moreover, is that since we Russians
have begun more and more to adopt the European
view of art, the same evolution has begun to show itself
in our language also, and some people speak and write
quite confidently, and without causing surprise, of beautiful
music and ugly actions, or even thoughts; whereas
forty years ago, when I was young, the expressions
"beautiful music" and "ugly actions" were not only
unusual, but incomprehensible. Evidently this new
meaning given to beauty by European thought begins
to be assimilated by Russian society.</p>

<p>And what really is this meaning? What is this
"beauty" as it is understood by the European peoples?</p>

<p>In order to answer this question, I must here quote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
at least a small selection of those definitions of beauty
most generally adopted in existing æsthetic systems. I
especially beg the reader not to be overcome by dullness,
but to read these extracts through, or, still better, to
read some one of the erudite æsthetic authors. Not to
mention the voluminous German æstheticians, a very
good book for this purpose would be either the German
book by Kralik, the English work by Knight, or the
French one by Lévêque. It is necessary to read one
of the learned æsthetic writers in order to form at firsthand
a conception of the variety in opinion and the
frightful obscurity which reigns in this region of speculation;
not, in this important matter, trusting to another's
report.</p>

<p>This, for instance, is what the German æsthetician
Schasler says in the preface to his famous, voluminous,
and detailed work on æsthetics:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hardly in any sphere of philosophic science can we
find such divergent methods of investigation and exposition,
amounting even to self-contradiction, as in the
sphere of æsthetics. On the one hand, we have elegant
phraseology without any substance, characterized
in great part by most one-sided superficiality; and on
the other hand, accompanying undeniable profundity
of investigation and richness of subject-matter, we get
a revolting awkwardness of philosophic terminology,
infolding the simplest thoughts in an apparel of abstract
science, as though to render them worthy to
enter the consecrated palace of the system; and finally,
between these two methods of investigation and exposition
there is a third, forming, as it were, the transition
from one to the other, a method consisting of eclecticism,
now flaunting an elegant phraseology, and now
a pedantic erudition.... A style of exposition that falls
into none of these three defects but it is truly concrete,
and, having important matter, expresses it in clear and
popular philosophic language, can nowhere be found
less frequently than in the domain of æsthetics."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>It is only necessary, for instance, to read Schasler's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
own book to convince oneself of the justice of this observation
of his.</p>

<p>On the same subject the French writer Véron, in the
preface to his very good work on æsthetics, says: "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il
n'y a pas de science, qui ait été plus que l'esthétique livrée
aux rêveries des métaphysiciens. Depuis Platon jusqu'aux
doctrines officielles de nos jours, on a fait de l'art je
ne sais quel amalgame de fantaisies quintessenciées, et de
mystères transcendantaux qui trouvent leur expression suprême
dans la conception absolue du Beau idéal, prototype
immuable et divin des choses réelles</i>" ("L'Esthétique,"
1878, p. 5).<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>If the reader will only be at the pains to peruse the
following extracts, defining beauty, taken from the chief
writers on æsthetics, he may convince himself that this
censure is thoroughly deserved.</p>

<p>I shall not quote the definitions of beauty attributed
to the ancients,&mdash;Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, etc., down
to Plotinus,&mdash;because, in reality, the ancients had not
that conception of beauty separated from goodness
which forms the basis and aim of æsthetics in our time.
By referring the judgments of the ancients on beauty to
our conception of it, as is usually done in æsthetics, we
give the words of the ancients a meaning which is not
theirs.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>


<p>I begin with the founder of æsthetics, Baumgarten
(1714-1762).</p>

<p>According to Baumgarten,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> the object of logical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
knowledge is Truth, the object of æsthetic (<em>i.e.</em> sensuous)
knowledge is Beauty. Beauty is the Perfect (the
Absolute) recognized through the senses; Truth is the
Perfect perceived through reason; Goodness is the Perfect
reached by moral will.</p>

<p>Beauty is defined by Baumgarten as a correspondence,
<em>i.e.</em> an order of the parts in their mutual relations to
each other and in their relation to the whole. The aim
of beauty itself is to please and excite a desire, "<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wohlgefallen
und Erregung eines Verlangens</i>." (A position
precisely the opposite of Kant's definition of the nature
and sign of beauty.)</p>

<p>With reference to the manifestations of beauty, Baumgarten
considers that the highest embodiment of beauty
is seen by us in nature, and he therefore thinks that the
highest aim of art is to copy nature. (This position also
is directly contradicted by the conclusions of the latest
æstheticians.)</p>

<p>Passing over the unimportant followers of Baumgarten,&mdash;Maier,
Eschenburg, and Eberhard,&mdash;who only
slightly modified the doctrine of their teacher by dividing
the pleasant from the beautiful, I will quote the
definitions given by writers who came immediately after
Baumgarten, and defined beauty quite in another way.
These writers were Sulzer, Mendelssohn, and Moritz.
They, in contradiction to Baumgarten's main position,
recognize as the aim of art, not beauty, but goodness.
Thus Sulzer (1720-1777) says that only that can be considered
beautiful which contains goodness. According
to his theory, the aim of the whole life of humanity is
welfare in social life. This is attained by the education
of the moral feelings, to which end art should be subservient.
Beauty is that which evokes and educates
this feeling.</p>

<p>Beauty is understood almost in the same way by
Mendelssohn (1729-1786). According to him, art is
the carrying forward of the beautiful, obscurely recognized
by feeling, till it becomes the true and good. The
aim of art is moral perfection.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>
<p>For the æstheticians of this school, the ideal of beauty
is a beautiful soul in a beautiful body. So that these
æstheticians completely wipe out Baumgarten's division
of the Perfect (the Absolute), into the three forms of
Truth, Goodness, and Beauty; and Beauty is again
united with the Good and the True.</p>

<p>But this conception is not only not maintained by the
later æstheticians, but the æsthetic doctrine of Winckelmann
arises, again in complete opposition. This divides
the mission of art from the aim of goodness in the sharpest
and most positive manner, makes external beauty the
aim of art, and even limits it to visible beauty.</p>

<p>According to the celebrated work of Winckelmann
(1717-1767), the law and aim of all art is beauty only,
beauty quite separated from and independent of goodness.
There are three kinds of beauty: (1) beauty
of form, (2) beauty of idea, expressing itself in the position
of the figure (in plastic art), (3) beauty of expression,
attainable only when the two first conditions are present.
This beauty of expression is the highest aim of art, and
is attained in antique art; modern art should therefore
aim at imitating ancient art.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Art is similarly understood by Lessing, Herder, and
afterwards by Goethe and by all the distinguished æstheticians
of Germany till Kant, from whose day, again, a
different conception of art commences.</p>

<p>Native æsthetic theories arose during this period in
England, France, Italy, and Holland, and they, though
not taken from the German, were equally cloudy and
contradictory. And all these writers, just like the German
æstheticians, founded their theories on a conception
of the Beautiful, understanding beauty in the sense of
a something existing absolutely, and more or less intermingled
with Goodness or having one and the same
root. In England, almost simultaneously with Baumgarten,
even a little earlier, Shaftesbury, Hutcheson,
Home, Burke, Hogarth, and others, wrote on art.</p>

<p>According to Shaftesbury (1670-1713), "That which
is beautiful is harmonious and proportionable, what is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
harmonious and proportionable is true, and what is at
once both beautiful and true is of consequence agreeable
and good."<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Beauty, he taught, is recognized by the
mind only. God is fundamental beauty; beauty and
goodness proceed from the same fount.</p>

<p>So that, although Shaftesbury regards beauty as being
something separate from goodness, they again merge
into something inseparable.</p>

<p>According to Hutcheson (1694-1747&mdash;"Inquiry into
the Original of our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue"), the
aim of art is beauty, the essence of which consists in
evoking in us the perception of uniformity amid variety.
In the recognition of what is art we are guided by "an
internal sense." This internal sense may be in contradiction
to the ethical one. So that, according to
Hutcheson, beauty does not always correspond with
goodness, but separates from it and is sometimes contrary
to it.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>According to Home, Lord Kames (1696-1782), beauty
is that which is pleasant. Therefore beauty is defined
by taste alone. The standard of true taste is that the
maximum of richness, fullness, strength, and variety of
impression should be contained in the narrowest limits.
That is the ideal of a perfect work of art.</p>

<p>According to Burke (1729-1797&mdash;"Philosophical Inquiry
into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and
Beautiful"), the sublime and beautiful, which are the
aim of art, have their origin in the promptings of self-preservation
and of society. These feelings, examined
in their source, are means for the maintenance of the
race through the individual. The first (self-preservation)
is attained by nourishment, defense, and war; the
second (society) by intercourse and propagation. Therefore
self-defense, and war, which is bound up with it, is
the source of the sublime; sociability, and the sex-instinct,
which is bound up with it, is the source of beauty.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>
<p>Such were the chief English definitions of art and
beauty in the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>During that period, in France, the writers on art were
Père André and Batteux, with Diderot, D'Alembert,
and, to some extent, Voltaire, following later.</p>

<p>According to Père André ("Essai sur le Beau,"
1741), there are three kinds of beauty,&mdash;divine beauty,
natural beauty, and artificial beauty.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>According to Batteux (1713-1780), art consists in
imitating the beauty of nature, its aim being enjoyment.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
Such is also Diderot's definition of art.</p>

<p>The French writers, like the English, consider that it
is taste that decides what is beautiful. And the laws of
taste are not only not laid down, but it is granted that
they cannot be settled. The same view was held by
D'Alembert and Voltaire.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>According to the Italian æsthetician of that period,
Pagano, art consists in uniting the beauties dispersed in
nature. The capacity to perceive these beauties is taste,
the capacity to bring them into one whole is artistic
genius. Beauty commingles with goodness, so that
beauty is goodness made visible, and goodness is inner
beauty.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>According to the opinion of other Italians: Muratori
(1672-1750),&mdash;"<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Riflessioni sopra il buon gusto intorno
le science e le arti</i>,"&mdash;and especially Spaletti,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>&mdash;"<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Saggio
sopra la bellezza</i>" (1765),&mdash;art amounts to an
egotistical sensation, founded (as with Burke) on the
desire for self-preservation and society.</p>

<p>Among Dutch writers, Hemsterhuis (1720-1790), who
had an influence on the German æstheticians and on
Goethe, is remarkable. According to him, beauty is
that which gives most pleasure, and that gives most
pleasure which gives us the greatest number of ideas in
the shortest time. Enjoyment of the beautiful, because
it gives the greatest quantity of perceptions in the shortest
time, is the highest notion to which man can attain.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>
<p>Such were the æsthetic theories outside Germany during
the last century. In Germany, after Winckelmann,
there again arose a completely new æsthetic theory, that
of Kant (1724-1804), which, more than all others, clears
up what this conception of beauty, and consequently of
art, really amounts to.</p>

<p>The æsthetic teaching of Kant is founded as follows:
Man has a knowledge of nature outside him and of
himself in nature. In nature, outside himself, he seeks
for truth; in himself, he seeks for goodness. The first
is an affair of pure reason, the other of practical reason
(free will). Besides these two means of perception, there
is yet the judging capacity (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Urteilskraft</i>), which forms
judgments without reasonings and produces pleasure
without desire (<i>Urtheil ohne Begriff und Vergnügen ohne
Begehren</i>). This capacity is the basis of æsthetic feeling.
Beauty, according to Kant, in its subjective meaning is
that which, in general and necessarily, without reasonings
and without practical advantage, pleases. In its
objective meaning it is the form of a suitable object, in
so far as that object is perceived without any conception
of its utility.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Beauty is defined in the same way by the followers
of Kant, among whom was Schiller (1759-1805). According
to Schiller, who wrote much on æsthetics, the
aim of art is, as with Kant, beauty, the source of which
is pleasure without practical advantage. So that art
may be called a game, not in the sense of an unimportant
occupation, but in the sense of a manifestation
of the beauties of life itself without other aim than
that of beauty.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Besides Schiller, the most remarkable of Kant's
followers in the sphere of æsthetics was Wilhelm
Humboldt, who, though he added nothing to the definition
of beauty, explained various forms of it,&mdash;the
drama, music, the comic, etc.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>After Kant, besides the second-rate philosophers,
the writers on æsthetics were Fichte, Schelling, Hegel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
and their followers. Fichte (1762-1814) says that perception
of the beautiful proceeds from this: the world&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
nature&mdash;has two sides: it is the sum of our
limitations, and it is the sum of our free idealistic activity.
In the first aspect the world is limited, in the
second aspect it is free. In the first aspect every
object is limited, distorted, compressed, confined&mdash;and
we see deformity; in the second we perceive its
inner completeness, vitality, regeneration&mdash;and we see
beauty. So that the deformity or beauty of an object,
according to Fichte, depends on the point of view of
the observer. Beauty therefore exists, not in the world,
but in the beautiful soul (<i>schöner Geist</i>). Art is the
manifestation of this beautiful soul, and its aim is the
education, not only of the mind&mdash;that is the business
of the <i>savant</i>, not only of the heart&mdash;that is the affair
of the moral preacher, but of the whole man. And so
the characteristic of beauty lies, not in anything external,
but in the presence of a beautiful soul in the artist.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Following Fichte, and in the same direction, Friedrich
Schlegel and Adam Müller also defined beauty.
According to Schlegel (1772-1829), beauty in art is
understood too incompletely, one-sidedly, and disconnectedly.
Beauty exists, not only in art, but also in
nature and in love; so that the truly beautiful is expressed
by the union of art, nature, and love. Therefore,
as inseparably one with æsthetic art, Schlegel
acknowledges moral and philosophic art.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>According to Adam Müller (1779-1829), there are
two kinds of beauty: the one, general beauty, which
attracts people as the sun attracts the planet&mdash;this is
found chiefly in antique art; and the other, individual
beauty, which results from the observer himself becoming
a sun, attracting beauty&mdash;this is the beauty
of modern art. A world in which all contradictions
are harmonized is the highest beauty. Every work
of art is a reproduction of this universal harmony.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
The highest art is the art of life.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>

<p>Next after Fichte and his followers came a contemporary
of his, the philosopher Schelling (1775-1854),
who has had a great influence on the æsthetic conceptions
of our times. According to Schelling's philosophy,
art is the production or result of that conception
of things by which the subject becomes its own object,
or the object its own subject. Beauty is the perception
of the infinite in the finite. And the chief characteristic
of works of art is unconscious infinity. Art is
the uniting of the subjective with the objective, of
nature with reason, of the unconscious with the conscious,
and therefore art is the highest means of
knowledge. Beauty is the contemplation of things in
themselves as they exist in the prototype (<i>In den
Urbildern</i>). It is not the artist who by his knowledge
or skill produces the beautiful, but the idea of
beauty in him itself produces it.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Of Schelling's followers the most noticeable was
Solger (1780-1819&mdash;"Vorlesungen über Æsthetik").
According to him, the idea of beauty is the fundamental
idea of everything. In the world we see only distortions
of the fundamental idea, but art, by imagination,
may lift itself to the height of this idea. Art is therefore
akin to creation.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>According to another follower of Schelling, Krause
(1781-1832), true, positive beauty is the manifestation
of the Idea in an individual form; art is the actualization
of the beauty existing in the sphere of man's free spirit.
The highest stage of art is the art of life, which directs
its activity toward the adornment of life so that it may
be a beautiful abode for a beautiful man.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>After Schelling and his followers came the new æsthetic
doctrine of Hegel, which is held to this day, consciously
by many, but by the majority unconsciously.
This teaching is not only no clearer or better defined
than the preceding ones, but is, if possible, even more
cloudy and mystical.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<p>According to Hegel (1770-1831), God manifests himself
in nature and in art in the form of beauty. God expresses
himself in two ways: in the object and in the
subject, in nature and in spirit. Beauty is the shining
of the Idea through matter. Only the soul, and what
pertains to it, is truly beautiful; and therefore the beauty
of nature is only the reflection of the natural beauty of
the spirit&mdash;the beautiful has only a spiritual content.
But the spiritual must appear in sensuous form. The
sensuous manifestation of spirit is only appearance
(<i>schein</i>), and this appearance is the only reality of the
beautiful. Art is thus the production of this appearance
of the Idea, and is a means, together with religion and
philosophy, of bringing to consciousness and of expressing
the deepest problems of humanity and the highest
truths of the spirit.</p>

<p>Truth and beauty, according to Hegel, are one and
the same thing; the difference being only that truth is
the Idea itself as it exists in itself, and is thinkable.
The Idea, manifested externally, becomes to the apprehension
not only true but beautiful. The beautiful
is the manifestation of the Idea.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>Following Hegel came his many adherents, Weisse,
Arnold Ruge, Rosenkrantz, Theodor Vischer, and others.</p>

<p>According to Weisse (1801-1867), art is the introduction
(<i>Einbildung</i>) of the absolute spiritual reality of
beauty into external, dead, indifferent matter, the perception
of which latter, apart from the beauty brought
into it, presents the negation of all existence in itself
(<i>Negation alles Fürsichseins</i>).</p>

<p>In the idea of truth, Weisse explains, lies a contradiction
between the subjective and the objective sides of
knowledge, in that an individual <i>I</i> discerns the Universal.
This contradiction can be removed by a conception
that should unite into one the universal and the
individual, which fall asunder in our conceptions of
truth. Such a conception would be reconciled (<i>aufgehoben</i>)
truth. Beauty is such a reconciled truth.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>
<p>According to Ruge (1802-1880), a strict follower of
Hegel, beauty is the Idea expressing itself. The spirit,
contemplating itself, either finds itself expressed completely,
and then that full expression of itself is beauty;
or incompletely, and then it feels the need to alter this
imperfect expression of itself, and becomes creative art.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>According to Vischer (1807-1887), beauty is the Idea
in the form of a finite phenomenon. The Idea itself is
not indivisible, but forms a system of ideas, which may
be represented by ascending and descending lines. The
higher the idea, the more beauty it contains; but even
the lowest contains beauty, because it forms an essential
link of the system. The highest form of the Idea is
personality, and therefore the highest art is that which
has for its subject-matter the highest personality.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>Such were the theories of the German æstheticians in
the Hegelian direction, but they did not monopolize æsthetic
dissertations. In Germany, side by side and simultaneously
with the Hegelian theories, there appeared
theories of beauty not only independent of Hegel's position
(that beauty is the manifestation of the Idea), but
directly contrary to this view, denying and ridiculing it.
Such was the line taken by Herbart and, more particularly,
by Schopenhauer.</p>

<p>According to Herbart (1776-1841), there is not, and
cannot be, any such thing as beauty existing in itself.
What does exist is only our opinion, and it is necessary
to find the base of this opinion (<i>Ästhetisches Elementarurtheil</i>).
Such bases are connected with our impressions.
There are certain relations which we term beautiful; and
art consists in finding these relations, which are simultaneous
in painting, the plastic art, and architecture,
successive and simultaneous in music, and purely successive
in poetry. In contradiction to the former æstheticians,
Herbart holds that objects are often beautiful
which express nothing at all, as, for instance, the rainbow,
which is beautiful for its lines and colors, and not for its
mythological connection with Iris or Noah's rainbow.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>
<p>Another opponent of Hegel was Schopenhauer, who
denied Hegel's whole system, his æsthetics included.</p>

<p>According to Schopenhauer (1788-1860), Will objectivizes
itself in the world on various planes; and although
the higher the plane on which it is objectivized the more
beautiful it is, yet each plane has its own beauty. Renunciation
of one's individuality and contemplation of
one of these planes of manifestation of Will gives us
a perception of beauty. All men, says Schopenhauer,
possess the capacity to objectivize the Idea on different
planes. The genius of the artist has this capacity in
a higher degree, and therefore makes a higher beauty
manifest.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>After these more eminent writers there followed, in
Germany, less original and less influential ones, such as
Hartmann, Kirkmann, Schnasse, and, to some extent,
Helmholtz (as an æsthetician), Bergmann, Jungmann,
and an innumerable host of others.</p>

<p>According to Hartmann (1842), beauty lies, not in the
external world, nor in "the thing in itself," neither does
it reside in the soul of man, but it lies in the "seeming"
(<i>Schein</i>) produced by the artist. The thing in itself
is not beautiful, but is transformed into beauty by the
artist.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>According to Schnasse (1798-1875), there is no perfect
beauty in the world. In nature there is only an
approach toward it. Art gives what nature cannot
give. In the energy of the free <i>ego</i>, conscious of harmony
not found in nature, beauty is disclosed.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Kirkmann wrote on experimental æsthetics. All aspects
of history in his system are joined by pure chance.
Thus, according to Kirkmann (1802-1884), there are
six realms of history: The realm of Knowledge, of
Wealth, of Morality, of Faith, of Politics, and of Beauty;
and activity in the last-named realm is art.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>According to Helmholtz (1821), who wrote on beauty
as it relates to music, beauty in musical productions is
attained only by following unalterable laws. These laws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
are not known to the artist; so that beauty is manifested
by the artist unconsciously, and cannot be subjected to
analysis.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>According to Bergmann (1840) ("Ueber das Schöne,"
1887), to define beauty objectively is impossible. Beauty
is only perceived subjectively, and therefore the problem
of æsthetics is to define what pleases whom.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>According to Jungmann (d. 1885), firstly, beauty is a
suprasensible quality of things; secondly, beauty produces
in us pleasure by merely being contemplated; and,
thirdly, beauty is the foundation of love.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>The æsthetic theories of the chief representatives of
France, England, and other nations in recent times have
been the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>In France, during this period, the prominent writers
on æsthetics were Cousin, Jouffroy, Pictet, Ravaisson,
Lévêque.</p>

<p>Cousin (1792-1867) was an eclectic, and a follower of
the German idealists. According to his theory, beauty
always has a moral foundation. He disputes the doctrine
that art is imitation and that the beautiful is what pleases.
He affirms that beauty may be defined objectively, and
that it essentially consists in variety in unity.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>After Cousin came Jouffroy (1796-1842), who was a
pupil of Cousin's and also a follower of the German
æstheticians. According to his definition, beauty is the
expression of the invisible by those natural signs which
manifest it. The visible world is the garment by means
of which we see beauty.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>The Swiss writer Pictet repeated Hegel and Plato,
supposing beauty to exist in the direct and free manifestation
of the divine Idea revealing itself in sense forms.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>Lévêque was a follower of Schelling and Hegel. He
holds that beauty is something invisible behind nature&mdash;a
force or spirit revealing itself in ordered energy.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>Similar vague opinions about the nature of beauty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
were expressed by the French metaphysician Ravaisson,
who considered beauty to be the ultimate aim and purpose
of the world. "<i>La beauté la plus divine et principalement
la plus parfaite contient le secret du monde.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
And again, "<i>Le monde entier est l'&oelig;uvre d'une beauté
absolue, qui n'est la cause des choses que par l'amour
qu'elle met en elles.</i>"</p>

<p>I purposely abstain from translating these metaphysical
expressions, because, however cloudy the Germans
may be, the French, once they absorb the theories of the
Germans and take to imitating them, far surpass them
in uniting heterogeneous conceptions into one expression,
and putting forward one meaning or another indiscriminately.
For instance, the French philosopher Renouvier,
when discussing beauty, says, "<i>Ne craignons pas
de dire qu'une vérité qui ne serait pas belle, ne serait qu'un
jeu logique de notre esprit et que la seule vérité solide et
digne de ce nom c'est la beauté.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>Besides the æsthetic idealists who wrote and still write
under the influence of German philosophy, the following
recent writers have also influenced the comprehension
of art and beauty in France: Taine, Guyau, Cherbuliez,
Coster, and Véron.</p>

<p>According to Taine (1828-1893), beauty is the manifestation
of the essential characteristic of any important
idea more completely than it is expressed in reality.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>Guyau (1854-1888) taught that beauty is not something
exterior to the object itself,&mdash;is not, as it were, a
parasitic growth on it,&mdash;but is itself the very blossoming
forth of that on which it appears. Art is the expression
of reasonable and conscious life, evoking in us both the
deepest consciousness of existence and the highest feelings
and loftiest thoughts. Art lifts man from his personal
life into the universal life by means, not only of
participation in the same ideas and beliefs, but also by
means of similarity in feeling.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>
<p>According to Cherbuliez, art is an activity, (1) satisfying
our innate love of forms (<i>apparences</i>), (2) endowing
these forms with ideas, (3) affording pleasure alike to
our senses, heart, and reason. Beauty is not inherent
in objects, but is an act of our souls. Beauty is an illusion;
there is no absolute beauty. But what we consider
characteristic and harmonious appears beautiful
to us.</p>

<p>Coster held that the ideas of the beautiful, the good,
and the true are innate. These ideas illuminate our
minds and are identical with God, who is Goodness,
Truth, and Beauty. The idea of Beauty includes unity
of essence, variety of constitutive elements, and order,
which brings unity into the various manifestations of
life.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>For the sake of completeness, I will further cite some
of the very latest writings upon art.</p>

<p>"La Psychologie du Beau et de l'Art, par Mario Pilo"
(1895), says that beauty is a product of our physical
feelings. The aim of art is pleasure, but this pleasure
(for some reason) he considers to be necessarily highly
moral.</p>

<p>The "Essai sur l'Art Contemporain, par Fierens
Gevaert" (1897), says that art rests on its connection
with the past, and on the religious ideal of the present
which the artist holds when giving to his work the form
of his individuality.</p>

<p>Then again, Sar Peladan's "L'Art Idealiste et Mystique"
(1894), says that beauty is one of the manifestations
of God. "<i>Il n'y a pas d'autre Réalité que Dieu,
il n'y a pas d'autre Vérité que Dieu, il n'y a pas d'autre
Beauté que Dieu</i>" (p. 33). This book is very fantastic
and very illiterate, but is characteristic in the positions it
takes up, and noticeable on account of a certain success
it is having with the younger generation in France.</p>

<p>All the æsthetics diffused in France up to the present
time are similar in kind, but among them Véron's
"L'Esthétique" (1878) forms an exception, being reasonable
and clear. That work, though it does not give an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
exact definition of art, at least rids æsthetics of the
cloudy conception of an absolute beauty.</p>

<p>According to Véron (1825-1889), art is the manifestation
of emotion transmitted externally by a combination
of lines, forms, colors, or by a succession of movements,
sounds, or words subjected to certain rhythms.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>In England, during this period, the writers on æsthetics
define beauty more and more frequently, not by its own
qualities, but by taste; and the discussion about beauty
is superseded by a discussion on taste.</p>

<p>After Reid (1704-1796), who acknowledged beauty as
being entirely dependent on the spectator, Alison, in his
"Essay on the Nature and Principles of Taste" (1790),
proved the same thing. From another side this was also
asserted by Erasmus Darwin (1731-1802), the grandfather
of the celebrated Charles Darwin.</p>

<p>He says that we consider beautiful that which is connected
in our conception with what we love. Richard
Knight's work, "An Analytical Inquiry into the Principles
of Taste," also tends in the same direction.</p>

<p>Most of the English theories of æsthetics are on the
same lines. The prominent writers on æsthetics in
England during the present century have been Charles
Darwin (to some extent), Herbert Spencer, Grant Allen,
Ker, and Knight.</p>

<p>According to Charles Darwin (1809-1882&mdash;"Descent
of Man," 1871), beauty is a feeling natural not only to
man, but also to animals, and consequently to the ancestors
of man. Birds adorn their nests and esteem beauty
in their mates. Beauty has an influence on marriages.
Beauty includes a variety of diverse conceptions. The
origin of the art of music is the call of the males to the
females.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>According to Herbert Spencer (b. 1820), the origin of
art is play, a thought previously expressed by Schiller.
In the lower animals all the energy of life is expended
in life-maintenance and race-maintenance; in man, however,
there remains, after these needs are satisfied,
some superfluous strength. This excess is used in play,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
which passes over into art. Play is an imitation of real
activity; so is art. The sources of æsthetic pleasure
are threefold: (1) That "which exercises the faculties
affected in the most complete ways, with the fewest
drawbacks from exercise," (2) "the difference of a
stimulus in large amount, which awakens a glow of
agreeable feeling," (3) the partial revival of the same,
with special combinations.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>In Todhunter's "Theory of the Beautiful" (1872),
beauty is infinite loveliness, which we apprehend both
by reason and by the enthusiasm of love. The recognition
of beauty as being such depends on taste; there
can be no criterion for it. The only approach to a definition
is found in culture. (What culture is, is not defined.)
Intrinsically, art&mdash;that which affects us through
lines, colors, sounds, or words&mdash;is not the product of
blind forces, but of reasonable ones, working, with mutual
helpfulness toward a reasonable aim. Beauty is the
reconciliation of contradictions.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>Grant Allen is a follower of Spencer, and in his
"Physiological Æsthetics" (1877) he says that beauty
has a physical origin. Æsthetic pleasures come from
the contemplation of the beautiful, but the conception of
beauty is obtained by a physiological process. The
origin of art is play; when there is a superfluity of
physical strength man gives himself to play; when there
is a superfluity of receptive power man gives himself to
art. The beautiful is that which affords the maximum
of stimulation with the minimum of waste. Differences
in the estimation of beauty proceed from taste. Taste
can be educated. We must have faith in the judgments
"of the finest-nurtured and most discriminative"
men. These people form the taste of the next generation.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>According to Ker's "Essay on the Philosophy of Art"
(1883), beauty enables us to make part of the objective
world intelligible to ourselves without being troubled by
reference to other parts of it, as is inevitable for science.
So that art destroys the opposition between the one and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
the many, between the law and its manifestation, between
the subject and its object, by uniting them. Art is the
revelation and vindication of freedom, because it is free
from the darkness and incomprehensibility of finite
things.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>According to Knight's "Philosophy of the Beautiful,"
Part II. (1893), beauty is (as with Schelling) the union of
object and subject, the drawing forth from nature of that
which is cognate to man, and the recognition in oneself
of that which is common to all nature.</p>

<p>The opinions on beauty and on art here mentioned
are far from exhausting what has been written on the
subject. And every day fresh writers on æsthetics arise,
in whose disquisitions appear the same enchanted confusion
and contradictoriness in defining beauty. Some,
by inertia, continue the mystical æsthetics of Baumgarten
and Hegel with sundry variations; others transfer the
question to the region of subjectivity, and seek for the
foundation of the beautiful in questions of taste; others&mdash;the
æstheticians of the very latest formation&mdash;seek
the origin of beauty in the laws of physiology; and
finally, others again investigate the question quite independently
of the conception of beauty. Thus Sully, in
his "Sensation and Intuition: Studies in Psychology
and Æsthetics" (1874), dismisses the conception of beauty
altogether, art, by his definition, being the production of
some permanent object or passing action fitted to supply
active enjoyment to the producer, and a pleasurable impression
to a number of spectators or listeners, quite apart
from any personal advantage derived from it.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<hr class="chap" />


<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>


<p>To what do these definitions of beauty amount? Not
reckoning the thoroughly inaccurate definitions of beauty
which fail to cover the conception of art, and which suppose
beauty to consist either in utility, or in adjustment
to a purpose, or in symmetry, or in order, or in proportion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
or in smoothness, or in harmony of the parts, or
in unity amid variety, or in various combinations of
these&mdash;not reckoning these unsatisfactory attempts at
objective definition, all the æsthetic definitions of beauty
lead to two fundamental conceptions. The first is that
beauty is something having an independent existence
(existing in itself), that it is one of the manifestations
of the absolutely Perfect, of the Idea, of the Spirit, of
Will, or of God; the other is that beauty is a kind of
pleasure received by us, not having personal advantage
for its object.</p>

<p>The first of these definitions was accepted by Fichte,
Schelling, Hegel, Schopenhauer, and the philosophizing
Frenchmen, Cousin, Jouffroy, Ravaisson, and others,
not to enumerate the second-rate æsthetic philosophers.
And this same objective-mystical definition of beauty is
held by a majority of the educated people of our day.
It is a conception very widely spread, especially among
the elder generation.</p>

<p>The second view, that beauty is a certain kind of
pleasure received by us, not having personal advantage
for its aim, finds favor chiefly among the English æsthetic
writers, and is shared by the other part of our
society, principally by the younger generation.</p>

<p>So there are (and it could not be otherwise) only two
definitions of beauty: the one objective, mystical, merging
this conception into that of the highest perfection,
God&mdash;a fantastic definition, founded on nothing; the
other, on the contrary, a very simple and intelligible
subjective one, which considers beauty to be that which
pleases (I do not add to the word "pleases" the words
"without the aim of advantage," because "pleases"
naturally presupposes the absence of the idea of profit).</p>

<p>On the one hand, beauty is viewed as something
mystical and very elevated, but unfortunately at the
same time very indefinite, and consequently embracing
philosophy, religion, and life itself (as in the theories of
Schelling and Hegel, and their German and French
followers); or, on the other hand (as necessarily follows
from the definition of Kant and his adherents),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
beauty is simply a certain kind of disinterested pleasure
received by us. And this conception of beauty,
although it seems very clear is, unfortunately, again inexact;
for it widens out on the other side, <i>i.e.</i> it includes
the pleasure derived from drink, from food, from touching
a delicate skin, etc., as is acknowledged by Guyau,
Kralik, and others.</p>

<p>It is true that, following the development of the æsthetic
doctrines on beauty, we may notice that, though
at first (in the times when the foundations of the science
of æsthetics were being laid) the metaphysical definition
of beauty prevailed, yet the nearer we get to our own
times the more does an experimental definition (recently
assuming a physiological form) come to the front, so
that at last we even meet with such æstheticians as
Véron and Sully, who try to escape entirely from the
conception of beauty. But such æstheticians have very
little success, and with the majority of the public, as
well as of artists and the learned, a conception of
beauty is firmly held which agrees with the definitions
contained in most of the æsthetic treatises, <i>i.e.</i> which
regards beauty either as something mystical or metaphysical,
or as a special kind of enjoyment.</p>

<p>What, then, is this conception of beauty, so stubbornly
held to by people of our circle and day as furnishing a
definition of art?</p>

<p>In the subjective aspect, we call beauty that which
supplies us with a particular kind of pleasure.</p>

<p>In the objective aspect, we call beauty something absolutely
perfect, and we acknowledge it to be so only
because we receive, from the manifestation of this absolute
perfection, a certain kind of pleasure; so that this
objective definition is nothing but the subjective conception
differently expressed. In reality both conceptions
of beauty amount to one and the same thing; namely,
the reception by us of a certain kind of pleasure; <i>i.e.</i> we
call "beauty" that which pleases us without evoking
in us desire.</p>

<p>Such being the position of affairs, it would seem only
natural that the science of art should decline to content<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
itself with a definition of art based on beauty (<i>i.e.</i> on
that which pleases), and seek a general definition, which
should apply to all artistic productions, and by reference
to which we might decide whether a certain article belonged
to the realm of art or not. But no such definition
is supplied, as the reader may see from those
summaries of the æsthetic theories which I have given,
and as he may discover even more clearly from the original
æsthetic works, if he will be at the pains to read
them. All attempts to define absolute beauty in itself&mdash;whether
as an imitation of nature, or as suitability to
its object, or as a correspondence of parts, or as symmetry,
or as harmony, or as unity in variety, etc.&mdash;either
define nothing at all, or define only some traits
of some artistic productions, and are far from including
all that everybody has always held, and still holds, to
be art.</p>

<p>There is no objective definition of beauty. The existing
definitions (both the metaphysical and the experimental)
amount only to one and the same subjective
definition, which (strange as it seems to say so) is, that
art is that which makes beauty manifest, and beauty is
that which pleases (without exciting desire). Many æstheticians
have felt the insufficiency and instability of
such a definition, and, in order to give it a firm basis,
have asked themselves why a thing pleases. And they
have converted the discussion on beauty into a question
concerning taste, as did Hutcheson, Voltaire, Diderot,
and others. But all attempts to define what taste is
must lead to nothing, as the reader may see both from
the history of æsthetics and experimentally. There is
and can be no explanation of why one thing pleases
one man and displeases another, or <i>vice versa</i>. So that
the whole existing science of æsthetics fails to do what
we might expect from it, being a mental activity calling
itself a science; namely, it does not define the qualities
and laws of art, or of the beautiful (if that be the content
of art), or the nature of taste (if taste decides the
question of art and its merit), and then, on the basis of
such definitions, acknowledge as art those productions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
which correspond to these laws, and reject those which
do not come under them. But this science of æsthetics
consists in first acknowledging a certain set of productions
to be art (because they please us), and then framing
such a theory of art that all those productions which
please a certain circle of people should fit into it. There
exists an art canon, according to which certain productions
favored by our circle are acknowledged as being
art,&mdash;Phidias, Sophocles, Homer, Titian, Raphael,
Bach, Beethoven, Dante, Shakespear, Goethe, and
others,&mdash;and the æsthetic laws must be such as to
embrace all these productions. In æsthetic literature
you will incessantly meet with opinions on the merit
and importance of art, founded not on any certain laws
by which this or that is held to be good or bad, but
merely on the consideration whether this art tallies with
the art canon we have drawn up.</p>

<p>The other day I was reading a far from ill-written
book by Folgeldt. Discussing the demand for morality
in works of art, the author plainly says that we must
not demand morality in art. And in proof of this he
advances the fact that if we admit such a demand,
Shakespear's "Romeo and Juliet," and Goethe's "Wilhelm
Meister," would not fit into the definition of good
art; but since both these books are included in our
canon of art, he concludes that the demand is unjust.
And therefore it is necessary to find a definition of art
which shall fit the works; and instead of a demand for
morality, Folgeldt postulates as the basis of art a
demand for the important (<i>Bedeutungsvolles</i>).</p>

<p>All the existing æsthetic standards are built on this
plan. Instead of giving a definition of true art, and
then deciding what is and what is not good art by judging
whether a work conforms or does not conform to
the definition, a certain class of works, which for some
reason please a certain circle of people, is accepted as
being art, and a definition of art is then devised to
cover all these productions. I recently came upon a
remarkable instance of this method in a very good German
work, "The History of Art in the Nineteenth Century,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
by Muther. Describing the pre-Raphaelites, the
Decadents and the Symbolists (who are already included
in the canon of art), he not only does not venture
to blame their tendency, but earnestly endeavors
to widen his standard so that it may include them all,
they appearing to him to represent a legitimate reaction
from the excesses of realism. No matter what insanities
appear in art, when once they find acceptance
among the upper classes of our society, a theory is
quickly invented to explain and sanction them; just as
if there had never been periods in history when certain
special circles of people recognized and approved false,
deformed, and insensate art which subsequently left no
trace and has been utterly forgotten. And to what
lengths the insanity and deformity of art may go, especially
when, as in our days, it knows that it is considered
infallible, may be seen by what is being done in the art
of our circle to-day.</p>

<p>So that the theory of art, founded on beauty, expounded
by æsthetics, and, in dim outline, professed by
the public, is nothing but the setting up as good of
that which has pleased and pleases us, <i>i.e.</i> pleases a
certain class of people.</p>

<p>In order to define any human activity, it is necessary
to understand its sense and importance. And, in order
to do that, it is primarily necessary to examine that
activity in itself, in its dependence on its causes, and in
connection with its effects, and not merely in relation
to the pleasure we can get from it.</p>

<p>If we say that the aim of any activity is merely our
pleasure, and define it solely by that pleasure, our definition
will evidently be a false one. But this is precisely
what has occurred in the efforts to define art. Now, if
we consider the food question, it will not occur to anyone
to affirm that the importance of food consists in
the pleasure we receive when eating it. Every one
understands that the satisfaction of our taste cannot
serve as a basis for our definition of the merits of
food, and that we have therefore no right to presuppose
that the dinners with cayenne pepper, Limburg cheese,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
alcohol, etc., to which we are accustomed and which
please us, form the very best human food.</p>

<p>And in the same way, beauty, or that which pleases
us, can in no sense serve as the basis for the definition
of art; nor can a series of objects which afford us
pleasure serve as the model of what art should be.</p>

<p>To see the aim and purpose of art in the pleasure we
get from it, is like assuming (as is done by people of
the lowest moral development, <i>e.g.</i> by savages) that the
purpose and aim of food is the pleasure derived when
consuming it.</p>

<p>Just as people who conceive the aim and purpose of
food to be pleasure cannot recognize the real meaning
of eating, so people who consider the aim of art to be
pleasure cannot realize its true meaning and purpose,
because they attribute to an activity, the meaning of
which lies in its connection with other phenomena of
life, the false and exceptional aim of pleasure. People
come to understand that the meaning of eating lies in
the nourishment of the body only when they cease to
consider that the object of that activity is pleasure.
And it is the same with regard to art. People will
come to understand the meaning of art only when they
cease to consider that the aim of that activity is beauty,
<i>i.e.</i> pleasure. The acknowledgment of beauty (<i>i.e.</i> of
a certain kind of pleasure received from art) as being
the aim of art, not only fails to assist us in finding a
definition of what art is, but, on the contrary, by transferring
the question into a region quite foreign to art
(into metaphysical, psychological, physiological, and
even historical discussions as to why such a production
pleases one person, and such another displeases or
pleases some one else), it renders such definition impossible.
And since discussions as to why one man
likes pears and another prefers meat do not help toward
finding a definition of what is essential in nourishment,
so the solution of questions of taste in art (to which the
discussions on art involuntarily come), not only does not
help to make clear what this particular human activity
which we call art really consists in, but renders such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
elucidation quite impossible, until we rid ourselves of a
conception which justifies every kind of art, at the cost
of confusing the whole matter.</p>

<p>To the question, What is this art, to which is offered
up the labor of millions, the very lives of men, and even
morality itself? we have extracted replies from the
existing æsthetics, which all amount to this that the
aim of art is beauty, that beauty is recognized by the enjoyment
it gives, and that artistic enjoyment is a good
and important thing, because it <i>is</i> enjoyment. In a
word, that enjoyment is good because it is enjoyment.
Thus, what is considered the definition of art is no
definition at all, but only a shuffle to justify existing
art. Therefore, however strange it may seem to say
so, in spite of the mountains of books written about
art, no exact definition of art has been constructed.
And the reason of this is that the conception of art has
been based on the conception of beauty.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>


<p>What is art, if we put aside the conception of beauty,
which confuses the whole matter? The latest and most
comprehensible definitions of art, apart from the conception
of beauty, are the following: (1 <i>a</i>) Art is an
activity arising even in the animal kingdom, and springing
from sexual desire and the propensity to play (Schiller,
Darwin, Spencer), and (1 <i>b</i>) accompanied by a pleasurable
excitement of the nervous system (Grant Allen).
This is the physiological-evolutionary definition. (2)
Art is the external manifestation, by means of lines,
colors, movements, sounds, or words, of emotions felt
by man (Véron). This is the experimental definition.
According to the very latest definition (Sully), (3) Art
is "the production of some permanent object or passing
action, which is fitted, not only to supply an active
enjoyment to the producer, but to convey a pleasurable
impression to a number of spectators or listeners, quite
apart from any personal advantage to be derived from it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the superiority of these definitions
to the metaphysical definitions which depended on the
conception of beauty, they are yet far from exact. (1 <i>a</i>)
The first, the physiological-evolutionary definition, is
inexact, because, instead of speaking about the artistic
activity itself, which is the real matter in hand, it treats
of the derivation of art. The modification of it (1 <i>b</i>),
based on the physiological effects on the human organism,
is inexact, because within the limits of such definition
many other human activities can be included, as
has occurred in the neo-æsthetic theories, which reckon
as art the preparation of handsome clothes, pleasant
scents, and even of victuals.</p>

<p>The experimental definition (2), which makes art
consist in the expression of emotions, is inexact, because
a man may express his emotions by means of lines,
colors, sounds, or words, and yet may not act on others
by such expression; and then the manifestation of his
emotions is not art.</p>

<p>The third definition (that of Sully) is inexact, because
in the production of objects or actions affording pleasure
to the producer and a pleasant emotion to the spectators
or hearers apart from personal advantage may be included
the showing of conjuring tricks or gymnastic
exercises, and other activities which are not art. And,
further, many things, the production of which does not
afford pleasure to the producer, and the sensation received
from which is unpleasant, such as gloomy, heartrending
scenes in a poetic description or a play, may
nevertheless be undoubted works of art.</p>

<p>The inaccuracy of all these definitions arises from
the fact that in them all (as also in the metaphysical
definitions) the object considered is the pleasure art may
give, and not the purpose it may serve in the life of man
and of humanity.</p>

<p>In order correctly to define art, it is necessary, first of
all, to cease to consider it as a means to pleasure, and
to consider it as one of the conditions of human life.
Viewing it in this way, we cannot fail to observe that art is
one of the means of intercourse between man and man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span></p>

<p>Every work of art causes the receiver to enter into a
certain kind of relationship both with him who produced,
or is producing, the art, and with all those who, simultaneously,
previously, or subsequently, receive the same
artistic impression.</p>

<p>Speech, transmitting the thoughts and experiences of
men, serves as a means of union among them, and art
acts in a similar manner. The peculiarity of this latter
means of intercourse, distinguishing it from intercourse
by means of words, consists in this, that whereas by
words a man transmits his thoughts to another, by means
of art he transmits his feelings.</p>

<p>The activity of art is based on the fact that a man,
receiving through his sense of hearing or sight another
man's expression of feeling, is capable of experiencing
the emotion which moved the man who expressed it.
To take the simplest example: one man laughs, and
another, who hears, becomes merry; or a man weeps,
and another, who hears, feels sorrow. A man is excited
or irritated, and another man, seeing him, comes to a
similar state of mind. By his movements, or by the
sounds of his voice, a man expresses courage and determination,
or sadness and calmness, and this state of mind
passes on to others. A man suffers, expressing his sufferings
by groans and spasms, and this suffering transmits
itself to other people; a man expresses his feeling
of admiration, devotion, fear, respect, or love to certain
objects, persons, or phenomena, and others are infected
by the same feelings of admiration, devotion, fear, respect,
or love to the same objects, persons, and phenomena.</p>

<p>And it is on this capacity of man to receive another
man's expression of feeling, and experience those feelings
himself, that the activity of art is based.</p>

<p>If a man infects another or others, directly, immediately,
by his appearance, or by the sounds he gives vent
to at the very time he experiences the feeling; if he
causes another man to yawn when he himself cannot
help yawning, or to laugh or cry when he himself is
obliged to laugh or cry, or to suffer when he himself is
suffering&mdash;that does not amount to art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span></p>

<p>Art begins when one person, with the object of joining
another or others to himself in one and the same
feeling, expresses that feeling by certain external indications.
To take the simplest example: a boy, having
experienced, let us say, fear on encountering a wolf, relates
that encounter; and, in order to evoke in others
the feeling he has experienced, describes himself, his
condition before the encounter, the surroundings, the
wood, his own light-heartedness, and then the wolf's
appearance, its movements, the distance between himself
and the wolf, etc. All this, if only the boy, when
telling the story, again experiences the feelings he had
lived through and infects the hearers and compels them
to feel what the narrator had experienced, is art. If
even the boy had not seen a wolf but had frequently
been afraid of one, and if, wishing to evoke in others
the fear he had felt, he invented an encounter with a
wolf, and recounted it so as to make his hearers share
the feelings he experienced when he feared the wolf,
that also would be art. And just in the same way it is
art if a man, having experienced either the fear of suffering
or the attraction of enjoyment (whether in reality
or in imagination), expresses these feelings on canvas
or in marble so that others are infected by them. And
it is also art if a man feels or imagines to himself feelings
of delight, gladness, sorrow, despair, courage, or
despondency, and the transition from one to another of
these feelings, and expresses these feelings by sounds,
so that the hearers are infected by them, and experience
them as they were experienced by the composer.</p>

<p>The feelings with which the artist infects others may
be most various,&mdash;very strong or very weak, very important
or very insignificant, very bad or very good:
feelings of love for native land, self-devotion and submission
to fate or to God expressed in a drama, raptures
of lovers described in a novel, feelings of voluptuousness
expressed in a picture, courage expressed in a triumphal
march, merriment evoked by a dance, humor
evoked by a funny story, the feeling of quietness transmitted
by an evening landscape or by a lullaby, or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
feeling of admiration evoked by a beautiful arabesque&mdash;it
is all art.</p>

<p>If only the spectators or auditors are infected by the
feelings which the author has felt, it is art.</p>

<p><i>To evoke in oneself a feeling one has once experienced,
and having evoked it in oneself, then, by means of movements,
lines, colors, sounds, or forms expressed in words,
so to transmit that feeling that others may experience the
same feeling&mdash;this is the activity of art.</i></p>

<p><i>Art is a human activity, consisting in this, that one
man consciously, by means of certain external signs, hands
on to others feelings he has lived through, and that other
people are infected by these feelings, and also experience
them.</i></p>

<p>Art is not, as the metaphysicians say, the manifestation
of some mysterious Idea of beauty, or God; it is
not, as the æsthetical physiologists say, a game in which
man lets off his excess of stored-up energy; it is not the
expression of man's emotions by external signs; it is not
the production of pleasing objects; and, above all, it is
not pleasure; but it is a means of union among men,
joining them together in the same feelings, and indispensable
for the life and progress toward well-being
of individuals and of humanity.</p>

<p>As, thanks to man's capacity to express thoughts by
words, every man may know all that has been done for
him in the realms of thought by all humanity before his
day, and can, in the present, thanks to this capacity to
understand the thoughts of others, become a sharer in
their activity, and can himself hand on to his contemporaries
and descendants the thoughts he has assimilated
from others, as well as those which have arisen within
himself; so, thanks to man's capacity to be infected
with the feelings of others by means of art, all that is
being lived through by his contemporaries is accessible
to him, as well as the feelings experienced by men
thousands of years ago, and he has also the possibility
of transmitting his own feelings to others.</p>

<p>If people lacked this capacity to receive the thoughts
conceived by the men who preceded them, and to pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
on to others their own thoughts, men would be like wild
beasts, or like Kaspar Hauser.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>And if men lacked this other capacity of being infected
by art, people might be almost more savage still, and,
above all, more separated from, and more hostile to, one
another.</p>

<p>And therefore the activity of art is a most important
one, as important as the activity of speech itself, and as
generally diffused.</p>

<p>We are accustomed to understand art to be only what
we hear and see in theaters, concerts, and exhibitions;
together with buildings, statues, poems, novels.... But all
this is but the smallest part of the art by which we communicate
with each other in life. All human life is filled
with works of art of every kind,&mdash;from cradle-song, jest,
mimicry, the ornamentation of houses, dress, and utensils,
up to church services, buildings, monuments, and triumphal
processions. It is all artistic activity. So that
by art, in the limited sense of the word, we do not mean
all human activity transmitting feelings, but only that
part which we for some reason select from it and to
which we attach special importance.</p>

<p>This special importance has always been given by all
men to that part of this activity which transmits feelings
flowing from their religious perception, and this small
part of art they have specifically called art, attaching to
it the full meaning of the word.</p>

<p>That was how men of old&mdash;Socrates, Plato, and
Aristotle&mdash;looked on art. Thus did the Hebrew prophets
and the ancient Christians regard art; thus it was,
and still is, understood by the Mahommedans, and thus
is it still understood by religious folk among our own
peasantry.</p>

<p>Some teachers of mankind&mdash;as Plato in his "Republic,"
and people such as the primitive Christians, the strict<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
Mahommedans, and the Buddhists&mdash;have gone so far
as to repudiate all art.</p>

<p>People viewing art in this way (in contradiction to the
prevalent view of to-day, which regards any art as good
if only it affords pleasure) considered, and consider, that
art (as contrasted with speech, which need not be
listened to) is so highly dangerous in its power to infect
people against their wills, that mankind will lose far less
by banishing all art than by tolerating each and every
art.</p>

<p>Evidently such people were wrong in repudiating all
art, for they denied that which cannot be denied,&mdash;one
of the indispensable means of communication, without
which mankind could not exist. But not less wrong are
the people of civilized European society of our class and
day, in favoring any art if it but serves beauty, <i>i.e.</i> gives
people pleasure.</p>

<p>Formerly, people feared lest among the works of art
there might chance to be some causing corruption, and
they prohibited art altogether. Now, they only fear lest
they should be deprived of any enjoyment art can afford,
and patronize any art. And I think the last error is
much grosser than the first, and that its consequences
are far more harmful.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>


<p>But how could it happen that that very art, which
in ancient times was merely tolerated (if tolerated at
all), should have come, in our times, to be invariably
considered a good thing if only it affords pleasure?</p>

<p>It has resulted from the following causes. The
estimation of the value of art (<i>i.e.</i> of the feelings it
transmits) depends on men's perception of the meaning
of life; depends on what they consider to be the
good and the evil of life. And what is good and what
is evil is defined by what are termed religions.</p>

<p>Humanity unceasingly moves forward from a lower,
more partial, and obscure understanding of life, to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
more general and more lucid. And in this, as in every
movement, there are leaders,&mdash;those who have understood
the meaning of life more clearly than others,&mdash;and
of these advanced men there is always one who
has, in his words and by his life, expressed this meaning
more clearly, accessibly, and strongly than others.
This man's expression of the meaning of life, together
with those superstitions, traditions, and ceremonies
which usually form themselves round the memory of
such a man, is what is called a religion. Religions
are the exponents of the highest comprehension of
life accessible to the best and foremost men at a
given time in a given society; a comprehension toward
which, inevitably and irresistibly, all the rest of that
society must advance. And therefore only religions
have always served, and still serve, as bases for the
valuation of human sentiments. If feelings bring men
nearer the ideal their religion indicates, if they are in
harmony with it and do not contradict it, they are
good; if they estrange men from it and oppose it,
they are bad.</p>

<p>If the religion places the meaning of life in worshiping
one God and fulfilling what is regarded as His
will, as was the case among the Jews, then the feelings
flowing from love to that God, and to His law, successfully
transmitted through the art of poetry by the
prophets, by the psalms, or by the epic of the book
of Genesis, is good, high art. All opposing that, as,
for instance, the transmission of feelings of devotion
to strange gods, or of feelings incompatible with the
law of God, would be considered bad art. Or if, as
was the case among the Greeks, the religion places
the meaning of life in earthly happiness, in beauty
and in strength, then art successfully transmitting the
joy and energy of life would be considered good art,
but art which transmitted feelings of effeminacy or
despondency would be bad art. If the meaning of
life is seen in the well-being of one's nation, or in
honoring one's ancestors and continuing the mode of
life led by them, as was the case among the Romans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
and the Chinese respectively, then art transmitting
feelings of joy at sacrificing one's personal well-being
for the common weal, or at exalting one's ancestors
and maintaining their traditions, would be considered
good art, but art expressing feelings contrary to this
would be regarded as bad. If the meaning of life is
seen in freeing oneself from the yoke of animalism,
as is the case among the Buddhists, then art successfully
transmitting feelings that elevate the soul and
humble the flesh will be good art, and all that transmits
feelings strengthening the bodily passions will be
bad art.</p>

<p>In every age, and in every human society, there
exists a religious sense, common to that whole society,
of what is good and what is bad, and it is this religious
conception that decides the value of the feelings transmitted
by art. And therefore, among all nations, art
which transmitted feelings considered to be good by
this general religious sense was recognized as being
good and was encouraged; but art which transmitted
feelings considered to be bad by this general religious
conception, was recognized as being bad, and was rejected.
All the rest of the immense field of art by
means of which people communicate one with another,
was not esteemed at all, and was only noticed when
it ran counter to the religious conception of its age,
and then merely to be repudiated. Thus it was among
all nations,&mdash;Greeks, Jews, Indians, Egyptians, and
Chinese,&mdash;and so it was when Christianity appeared.</p>

<p>The Christianity of the first centuries recognized as
productions of good art only legends, lives of saints,
sermons, prayers, and hymn-singing, evoking love of
Christ, emotion at His life, desire to follow His example,
renunciation of worldly life, humility, and the love of
others; all productions transmitting feelings of personal
enjoyment they considered to be bad, and therefore
rejected: for instance, tolerating plastic representations
only when they were symbolical, they rejected all the
pagan sculptures.</p>

<p>This was so among the Christians of the first centuries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
who accepted Christ's teaching, if not quite in
its true form, at least not in the perverted, paganized
form in which it was accepted subsequently.</p>

<p>But besides this Christianity, from the time of the
wholesale conversion of nations by order of the authorities,
as in the days of Constantine, Charlemagne,
and Vladimir, there appeared another, a Church Christianity,
which was nearer to paganism than to Christ's
teaching. And this Church Christianity, in accordance
with its own teaching, estimated quite otherwise
the feelings of people and the productions of art which
transmitted those feelings.</p>

<p>This Church Christianity not only did not acknowledge
the fundamental and essential positions of true
Christianity,&mdash;the immediate relationship of each man
to the Father, the consequent brotherhood and equality
of all men, and the substitution of humility and love
in place of every kind of violence,&mdash;but, on the contrary,
having set up a heavenly hierarchy similar to
the pagan mythology, and having introduced the worship
of Christ, of the Virgin, of angels, of apostles, of
saints, and of martyrs, and not only of these divinities
themselves, but also of their images, it made blind faith
in the Church and its ordinances the essential point of
its teaching.</p>

<p>However foreign this teaching may have been to
true Christianity; however degraded, not only in comparison
with true Christianity, but even with the life-conception
of Romans such as Julian and others,&mdash;it
was, for all that, to the barbarians who accepted it, a
higher doctrine than their former adoration of gods,
heroes, and good and bad spirits. And therefore this
teaching was a religion to them, and on the basis of
that religion the art of the time was assessed. And
art transmitting pious adoration of the Virgin, Jesus,
the saints and the angels, a blind faith in and submission
to the Church, fear of torments and hope of
blessedness in a life beyond the grave, was considered
good; all art opposed to this was considered bad.</p>

<p>The teaching on the basis of which this art arose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
was a perversion of Christ's teaching, but the art
which sprang up on this perverted teaching was nevertheless
a true art, because it corresponded to the religious
view of life held by the people among whom
it arose.</p>

<p>The artists of the Middle Ages, vitalized by the
same source of feeling&mdash;religion&mdash;as the mass of the
people, and transmitting, in architecture, sculpture,
painting, music, poetry or drama, the feelings and
states of mind they experienced, were true artists;
and their activity, founded on the highest conceptions
accessible to their age and common to the entire people,
though, for our times a mean art, was, nevertheless
a true one, shared by the whole community.</p>

<p>And this was the state of things until, in the upper,
rich, more educated classes of European society, doubt
arose as to the truth of that understanding of life
which was expressed by Church Christianity. When,
after the Crusades and the maximum development of
papal power and its abuses, people of the rich classes
became acquainted with the wisdom of the classics, and
saw, on the one hand, the reasonable lucidity of the
teaching of the ancient sages, and, on the other hand,
the incompatibility of the Church doctrine with the
teaching of Christ, they lost all possibility of continuing
to believe the Church teaching.</p>

<p>If, in externals, they still kept to the forms of Church
teaching, they could no longer believe in it, and held to
it only by inertia and for the sake of influencing the
masses, who continued to believe blindly in Church
doctrine, and whom the upper classes, for their own
advantage, considered it necessary to support in those
beliefs.</p>

<p>So that a time came when Church Christianity ceased
to be the general religious doctrine of all Christian
people; some&mdash;the masses&mdash;continued blindly to
believe in it, but the upper classes&mdash;those in whose
hands lay the power and wealth, and therefore the
leisure to produce art and the means to stimulate it&mdash;ceased
to believe in that teaching.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span></p>

<p>In respect to religion, the upper circles of the Middle
Ages found themselves in the same position in which
the educated Romans were before Christianity arose, <i>i.e.</i>
they no longer believed in the religion of the masses,
but had no beliefs to put in place of the worn-out
Church doctrine which for them had lost its meaning.</p>

<p>There was only this difference: that whereas for the
Romans, who lost faith in their emperor-gods and
household-gods, it was impossible to extract anything
further from all the complex mythology they had
borrowed from all the conquered nations, and it was
consequently necessary to find a completely new conception
of life, the people of the Middle Ages, when
they doubted the truth of the Church teaching, had no
need to seek a fresh one. That Christian teaching
which they professed in a perverted form as Church
doctrine had mapped out the path of human progress
so far ahead that they had but to rid themselves of
those perversions which hid the teaching announced by
Christ, and to adopt its real meaning&mdash;if not completely,
then at least in some greater degree than that in which
the Church had held it. And this was partially done,
not only in the reformations of Wyclif, Huss, Luther,
and Calvin, but by all that current of non-Church
Christianity represented in earlier times by the Paulicians,
the Bogomili,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> and, afterward, by the Waldenses
and the other non-Church Christians who were called
heretics. But this could be, and was, done chiefly by
poor people&mdash;who did not rule. A few of the rich
and strong, like Francis of Assisi and others, accepted
the Christian teaching in its full significance, even
though it undermined their privileged positions. But
most people of the upper classes (though in the depth
of their souls they had lost faith in the Church teaching)
could not or would not act thus, because the essence
of that Christian view of life, which stood ready to
be adopted when once they rejected the Church faith,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
was a teaching of the brotherhood (and therefore the
equality) of man, and this negatived those privileges
on which they lived, in which they had grown up and
been educated, and to which they were accustomed.
Not, in the depth of their hearts, believing in the
Church teaching,&mdash;which had outlived its age and
had no longer any true meaning for them,&mdash;and not
being strong enough to accept true Christianity, men
of these rich, governing classes&mdash;popes, kings, dukes,
and all the great ones of the earth&mdash;were left without
any religion, with but the external forms of one, which
they supported as being profitable and even necessary
for themselves, since these forms screened a teaching
which justified those privileges which they made use of.
In reality, these people believed in nothing, just as the
Romans of the first centuries of our era believed in
nothing. But at the same time these were the people
who had the power and the wealth, and these were the
people who rewarded art and directed it.</p>

<p>And, let it be noticed, it was just among these people
that there grew up an art esteemed, not according to its
success in expressing men's religious feelings, but in
proportion to its beauty,&mdash;in other words, according to
the enjoyment it gave.</p>

<p>No longer able to believe in the Church religion,
whose falsehood they had detected, and incapable of
accepting true Christian teaching, which denounced
their whole manner of life, these rich and powerful
people, stranded without any religious conception of
life, involuntarily returned to that pagan view of things
which places life's meaning in personal enjoyment.
And then took place among the upper classes what is
called the "Renaissance of science and art," and which
was really not only a denial of every religion, but also
an assertion that religion is unnecessary.</p>

<p>The Church doctrine is so coherent a system that it
cannot be altered or corrected without destroying it
altogether. As soon as doubt arose with regard to the
infallibility of the Pope (and this doubt was then in the
minds of all educated people), doubt inevitably followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
as to the truth of tradition. But doubt as to the truth
of tradition is fatal not only to popery and Catholicism,
but also to the whole Church creed, with all its dogmas:
the divinity of Christ, the resurrection, and the Trinity;
and it destroys the authority of the Scriptures, since
they were considered to be inspired only because the
tradition of the Church decided it so.</p>

<p>So that the majority of the highest classes of that
age, even the popes and the ecclesiastics, really believed
in nothing at all. In the Church doctrine these people
did not believe, for they saw its insolvency; but neither
could they follow Francis of Assisi, Keltchitsky,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> and
most of the heretics, in acknowledging the moral, social
teaching of Christ, for that teaching undermined their
social position. And so these people remained without
any religious view of life. And, having none, they
could have no standard wherewith to estimate what was
good and what was bad art but that of personal enjoyment.
And, having acknowledged their criterion of what
was good to be pleasure, <i>i.e.</i> beauty, these people of the
upper classes of European society went back in their
comprehension of art to the gross conception of the
primitive Greeks which Plato had already condemned.
And conformably to this understanding of life, a theory
of art was formulated.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>


<p>From the time that people of the upper classes lost
faith in Church Christianity, beauty (<i>i.e.</i> the pleasure received
from art) became their standard of good and bad
art. And, in accordance with that view, an æsthetic
theory naturally sprang up among those upper classes
justifying such a conception,&mdash;a theory according to
which the aim of art is to exhibit beauty. The partizans
of this æsthetic theory, in confirmation of its truth, affirmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
that it was no invention of their own, but that it
existed in the nature of things, and was recognized even
by the ancient Greeks. But this assertion was quite
arbitrary, and has no foundation other than the fact
that among the ancient Greeks, in consequence of the
low grade of their moral ideal (as compared with the
Christian), their conception of the good, &#964;&#8056; &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#8057;&#957;, was
not yet sharply divided from their conception of the
beautiful, &#964;&#8056; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#8056;&#957;.</p>

<p>That highest perfection of goodness (not only not
identical with beauty, but, for the most part, contrasting
with it) which was discerned by the Jews even in
the times of Isaiah, and fully expressed by Christianity,
was quite unknown to the Greeks. They supposed that
the beautiful must necessarily also be the good. It is
true that their foremost thinkers&mdash;Socrates, Plato,
Aristotle&mdash;felt that goodness may happen not to coincide
with beauty. Socrates expressly subordinated beauty
to goodness; Plato, to unite the two conceptions, spoke
of spiritual beauty; while Aristotle demanded from art
that it should have a moral influence on people (&#954;&#8049;&#952;&#945;&#961;&#963;&#953;&#962;).
But, notwithstanding all this, they could not quite dismiss
the notion that beauty and goodness coincide.</p>

<p>And consequently, in the language of that period, a
compound word (&#954;&#945;&#955;&#959;-&#954;&#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#8055;&#945;, beauty-goodness) came
into use to express that notion.</p>

<p>Evidently the Greek sages began to draw near to that
perception of goodness which is expressed in Buddhism
and in Christianity, and they got entangled in defining
the relation between goodness and beauty. Plato's
reasonings about beauty and goodness are full of contradictions.
And it was just this confusion of ideas
that those Europeans of a later age, who had lost all
faith, tried to elevate into a law. They tried to prove
that this union of beauty and goodness is inherent in the
very essence of things; that beauty and goodness must
coincide; and that the word and conception &#954;&#945;&#955;&#959;-&#954;&#7936;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#8055;&#945;
(which had a meaning for Greeks, but has none at all for
Christians) represents the highest ideal of humanity. On
this misunderstanding the new science of æsthetics was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
built up. And, to justify its existence, the teachings of
the ancients on art were so twisted as to make it appear
that this invented science of æsthetics had existed among
the Greeks.</p>

<p>In reality, the reasoning of the ancients on art was
quite unlike ours. As Benard, in his book on the æsthetics
of Aristotle, quite justly remarks, "<i>Pour qui veut
y regarder de près, la théorie du beau et celle de l'art sont
tout à fait séparées dans Aristote, comme elles le sont dans
Platon et chez tous leurs successeurs</i>" ("L'Esthétique
d'Aristote et de ses Successeurs," Paris, 1889, p. 28).<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
And indeed the reasoning of the ancients on art not
only does not confirm our science of æsthetics, but rather
contradicts its doctrine of beauty. But nevertheless all
the æsthetic guides, from Schasler to Knight, declare
that the science of the beautiful&mdash;æsthetic science&mdash;was
commenced by the ancients, by Socrates, Plato,
Aristotle; and was continued, they say, partially by
the Epicureans and Stoics: by Seneca and Plutarch,
down to Plotinus. But it is supposed that this science,
by some unfortunate accident, suddenly vanished in the
fourth century, and stayed away for about 1500 years,
and only after these 1500 years had passed did it revive
in Germany, 1750 <small>A.D.</small>, in Baumgarten's doctrine.</p>

<p>After Plotinus, says Schasler, fifteen centuries passed
away during which there was not the slightest scientific
interest felt for the world of beauty and art. These one
and a half thousand years, says he, have been lost to
æsthetics, and have contributed nothing toward the
erection of the learned edifice of this science.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span></p>
<p>In reality nothing of the kind happened. The science
of æsthetics, the science of the beautiful, neither did nor
could vanish, because it never existed. Simply, the
Greeks (just like everybody else, always and everywhere)
considered art (like everything else) good only when it
served goodness (as they understood goodness), and bad
when it was in opposition to that goodness. And the
Greeks themselves were so little developed morally, that
goodness and beauty seemed to them to coincide. On
that obsolete Greek view of life was erected the science
of æsthetics, invented by men of the eighteenth century,
and especially shaped and mounted in Baumgarten's
theory. The Greeks (as any one may see who will read
Benard's admirable book on Aristotle and his successors
and Walter's work on Plato) never had a science of
æsthetics.</p>

<p>Æsthetic theories arose about one hundred and fifty
years ago among the wealthy classes of the Christian
European world, and arose simultaneously among different
nations,&mdash;German, Italian, Dutch, French, and
English. The founder and organizer of it, who gave it
a scientific, theoretic form, was Baumgarten.</p>

<p>With a characteristically German, external exactitude,
pedantry, and symmetry, he devised and expounded this
extraordinary theory. And, notwithstanding its obvious
insolidity, nobody else's theory so pleased the cultured
crowd, or was accepted so readily and with such an
absence of criticism. It so suited the people of the
upper classes, that to this day, notwithstanding its entirely
fantastic character and the arbitrary nature of its
assertions, it is repeated by learned and unlearned as
though it were something indubitable and self-evident.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Habent sua fata libelli pro capite lectoris</i>, and so, or
even more so, theories <i>habent sua fata</i> according to the
condition of error in which that society is living, among
whom and for whom the theories are invented. If a
theory justifies the false position in which a certain
part of a society is living, then, however unfounded or
even obviously false the theory may be, it is accepted,
and becomes an article of faith to that section of society.
Such, for instance, was the celebrated and unfounded
theory, expounded by Malthus, of the tendency of that
population of the world to increase in geometrical
progression, but of the means of sustenance to increase
only in arithmetical progression, and of the consequent
over-population of the world; such, also, was the theory
(an outgrowth of the Malthusian) of selection and struggle
for existence as the basis of human progress. Such,
again, is Marx's theory, which regards the gradual destruction
of small private production by large capitalistic
production, now going on around us, as an inevitable
decree of fate. However unfounded such theories are,
however contrary to all that is known and confessed by
humanity, and however obviously immoral they may be,
they are accepted with credulity, pass uncriticized, and
are preached, perchance for centuries, until the conditions
are destroyed which they served to justify, or until
their absurdity has become too evident. To this class
belongs this astonishing theory of the Baumgartenian
Trinity,&mdash;Goodness, Beauty, and Truth,&mdash;according to
which it appears that the very best that can be done
by the art of nations after 1900 years of Christian teaching,
is to choose as the ideal of their life the ideal that
was held by a small, semi-savage, slave-holding people
who lived 2000 years ago, who imitated the nude human
body extremely well, and erected buildings pleasant to
look at. All these incompatibilities pass completely
unnoticed. Learned people write long, cloudy treatises
on beauty as a member of the æsthetic trinity of Beauty,
Truth, and Goodness: <i>das Schöne</i>, <i>das Wahre</i>, <i>das Gute</i>;
<i>le Beau</i>, <i>le Vrai</i>, <i>le Bon</i>, are repeated, with capital letters,
by philosophers, æstheticians, and artists, by private individuals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
by novelists, and by <i>feuilletonistes</i>, and they
all think, when pronouncing these sacrosanct words,
that they speak of something quite definite and solid&mdash;something
on which they can base their opinions. In
reality, these words not only have no definite meaning,
but they hinder us in attaching any definite meaning to
existing art; they are wanted only for the purpose of
justifying the false importance we attribute to an art
that transmits every kind of feeling, if only those feelings
afford us pleasure.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>


<p>But if art is a human activity having for its purpose
the transmission to others of the highest and best feelings
to which men have risen, how could it be that
humanity for a certain rather considerable period of its
existence (from the time people ceased to believe in
Church doctrine down to the present day) should exist
without this important activity, and, instead of it, should
put up with an insignificant artistic activity only affording
pleasure?</p>

<p>In order to answer this question, it is necessary, first
of all, to correct the current error people make in
attributing to our art the significance of true, universal
art. We are so accustomed, not only naïvely to consider
the Circassian family the best stock of people, but
also the Anglo-Saxon race the best race if we are Englishmen
or Americans, or the Teutonic if we are Germans,
or the Gallo-Latin if we are French, or the
Slavonic if we are Russians, that, when speaking of our
own art, we feel fully convinced, not only that our art is
true art, but even that it is the best and only true art.
But in reality our art is not only not the only art (as
the Bible once was held to be the only book), but it is
not even the art of the whole of Christendom&mdash;only
of a small section of that part of humanity. It was
correct to speak of a national Jewish, Grecian, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
Egyptian art, and one may speak of a now-existing
Chinese, Japanese, or Indian art shared in by a whole
people. Such art, common to a whole nation, existed
in Russia till Peter the First's time, and existed in the
rest of Europe until the thirteenth or fourteenth century;
but since the upper classes of European society, having
lost faith in the Church teaching, did not accept real
Christianity but remained without any faith, one can no
longer speak of an art of the Christian nations in the
sense of the whole of art. Since the upper classes
of the Christian nations lost faith in Church Christianity,
the art of those upper classes has separated itself from
the art of the rest of the people, and there have been
two arts,&mdash;the art of the people and genteel art. And
therefore the answer to the question, How it could occur
that humanity lived for a certain period without real
art, replacing it by art which served enjoyment only? is,
that not all humanity, nor even any considerable portion
of it, lived without real art, but only the highest classes
of European Christian society, and even they only for
a comparatively short time,&mdash;from the commencement
of the Renaissance down to our own day.</p>

<p>And the consequence of this absence of true art
showed itself, inevitably, in the corruption of that class
which nourished itself on the false art. All the confused,
unintelligible theories of art, all the false and contradictory
judgments on art, and particularly the self-confident
stagnation of our art in its false path, all arise from
the assertion, which has come into common use and is
accepted as an unquestioned truth, but is yet amazingly
and palpably false, the assertion, namely, that the art
of our upper classes<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> is the whole of art, the true, the
only, the universal art. And although this assertion
(which is precisely similar to the assertion made by
religious people of the various Churches who consider
that theirs is the only true religion) is quite arbitrary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
and obviously unjust, yet it is calmly repeated by all
the people of our circle with full faith in its infallibility.</p>

<p>The art we have is the whole of art, the real, the only
art, and yet two-thirds of the human race (all the peoples
of Asia and Africa) live and die knowing nothing of this
sole and supreme art. And even in our Christian society
hardly one per cent of the people make use of this
art which we speak of as being the <i>whole</i> of art; the
remaining ninety-nine per cent live and die, generation
after generation, crushed by toil, and never tasting this
art, which, moreover, is of such a nature that, if they
could get it, they would not understand anything of it.
We, according to the current æsthetic theory, acknowledge
art as one of the highest manifestations of the
Idea, God, Beauty, or as the highest spiritual enjoyment;
furthermore, we hold that all people have equal rights,
if not to material, at any rate to spiritual well-being;
and yet ninety-nine per cent of our European population
live and die, generation after generation, crushed
by toil, much of which toil is necessary for the production
of our art which they never use, and we, nevertheless,
calmly assert that the art which we produce is the
real, true, only art&mdash;all of art!</p>

<p>To the remark that if our art is the true art every one
should have the benefit of it, the usual reply is that if
not everybody at present makes use of existing art, the
fault lies, not in the art, but in the false organization of
society; that one can imagine to oneself, in the future,
a state of things in which physical labor will be partly
superseded by machinery, partly lightened by its just
distribution, and that labor for the production of art will
be taken in turns; that there is no need for some people
always to sit below the stage moving the decorations,
winding up the machinery, working at the piano or
French horn, and setting type and printing books, but
that the people who do all this work might be engaged
only a few hours per day, and in their leisure time might
enjoy all the blessings of art.</p>

<p>That is what the defenders of our exclusive art say.
But I think they do not themselves believe it. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
cannot help knowing that fine art can arise only on the
slavery of the masses of the people, and can continue
only as long as that slavery lasts, and they cannot help
knowing that only under conditions of intense labor for
the workers, can specialists&mdash;writers, musicians, dancers,
and actors&mdash;arrive at that fine degree of perfection to
which they do attain, or produce their refined works of
art; and only under the same conditions can there be a
fine public to esteem such productions. Free the slaves
of capital, and it will be impossible to produce such refined
art.</p>

<p>But even were we to admit the inadmissible, and say
that means may be found by which art (that art which
among us is considered to be art) may be accessible to
the whole people, another consideration presents itself
showing that fashionable art cannot be the whole of art,
viz., the fact that it is completely unintelligible to the
people. Formerly men wrote poems in Latin, but now
their artistic productions are as unintelligible to the common
folk as if they were written in Sanscrit. The usual
reply to this is, that if the people do not now understand
this art of ours, it only proves that they are undeveloped,
and that this has been so at each fresh step forward
made by art. First it was not understood, but afterward
people got accustomed to it.</p>

<p>"It will be the same with our present art; it will be
understood when everybody is as well educated as we
are&mdash;the people of the upper classes&mdash;who produce
this art," say the defenders of our art. But this assertion
is evidently even more unjust than the former; for we
know that the majority of the productions of the art of
the upper classes, such as various odes, poems, dramas,
cantatas, pastorals, pictures, etc., which delighted the
people of the upper classes when they were produced,
never were afterward either understood or valued by
the great masses of mankind, but have remained, what
they were at first, a mere pastime for rich people of
their time, for whom alone they ever were of any importance.
It is also often urged, in proof of the assertion
that the people will some day understand our art,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
that some productions of so-called "classical" poetry,
music, or painting, which formerly did not please the
masses, do&mdash;now that they have been offered to them
from all sides&mdash;begin to please these same masses;
but this only shows that the crowd, especially the half-spoilt
town crowd, can easily (its taste having been perverted)
be accustomed to any sort of art. Moreover, this
art is not produced by these masses, nor even chosen
by them, but is energetically thrust upon them in those
public places in which art is accessible to the people.
For the great majority of working-people, our art, besides
being inaccessible on account of its costliness, is
strange in its very nature, transmitting, as it does, the
feelings of people far removed from those conditions of
laborious life which are natural to the great body of
humanity. That which is enjoyment to a man of the
rich classes is incomprehensible, as a pleasure, to a
working-man, and evokes in him, either no feeling at
all, or only a feeling quite contrary to that which it
evokes in an idle and satiated man. Such feelings as
form the chief subjects of present-day art&mdash;say, for
instance, honor,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> patriotism, and amorousness&mdash;evoke
in a working-man only bewilderment and contempt, or
indignation. So that even if a possibility were given to
the laboring classes, in their free time, to see, to read,
and to hear all that forms the flower of contemporary
art (as is done to some extent, in towns, by means of
picture galleries, popular concerts, and libraries), the
working-man (to the extent to which he is a laborer,
and has not begun to pass into the ranks of those perverted
by idleness) would be able to make nothing of
our fine art, and if he did understand it, that which he
understood would not elevate his soul, but would certainly,
in most cases, pervert it. To thoughtful and
sincere people there can, therefore, be no doubt that the
art of our upper classes never can be the art of the whole
people. But if art is an important matter, a spiritual
blessing, essential for all men ("like religion," as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
devotees of art are fond of saying), then it should be
accessible to every one. And if, as in our day, it is not
accessible to all men, then one of two things: either art
is not the vital matter it is represented to be, or that art
which we call art is not the real thing.</p>

<p>The dilemma is inevitable, and therefore clever and
immoral people avoid it by denying one side of it, viz.,
denying that the common people have a right to art.
These people simply and boldly speak out (what lies at
the heart of the matter), and say that the participators
in and utilizers of what, in their esteem, is highly beautiful
art, <i>i.e.</i> art furnishing the greatest enjoyment, can
only be "schöne Geister," "the elect," as the romanticists
called them, the "Uebermenschen," as they are
called by the followers of Nietzsche; the remaining
vulgar herd, incapable of experiencing these pleasures,
must serve the exalted pleasures of this superior breed
of people. The people who express these views at least
do not pretend, and do not try, to combine the incombinable,
but frankly admit, what is the case, that our art
is an art of the upper classes only. So essentially art
has been, and is, understood by every one engaged on it
in our society.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>


<p>The unbelief of the upper classes of the European
world had this effect&mdash;that instead of an artistic activity
aiming at transmitting the highest feelings to which
humanity has attained,&mdash;those flowing from religious
perception,&mdash;we have an activity which aims at affording
the greatest enjoyment to a certain class of society.
And of all the immense domain of art, that part has been
fenced off, and is alone called art, which affords enjoyment
to the people of this particular circle.</p>

<p>Apart from the moral effects on European society of
such a selection from the whole sphere of art of what
did not deserve such a valuation, and the acknowledgment
of it as important art, this perversion of art has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
weakened art itself, and well-nigh destroyed it. The
first great result was that art was deprived of the infinite,
varied, and profound religious subject-matter proper to
it. The second result was that having only a small circle
of people in view, it lost its beauty of form and became
affected and obscure; and the third and chief result was
that it ceased to be either natural or even sincere, and
became thoroughly artificial and brain-spun.</p>

<p>The first result&mdash;the impoverishment of subject-matter&mdash;followed
because only that is a true work of
art which transmits fresh feelings not before experienced
by man. As thought-product is only then real thought-product
when it transmits new conceptions and thoughts,
and does not merely repeat what was known before, so
also an art-product is only then a genuine art-product
when it brings a new feeling (however insignificant) into
the current of human life. This explains why children
and youths are so strongly impressed by those works of
art which first transmit to them feelings they had not
before experienced.</p>

<p>The same powerful impression is made on people by
feelings which are quite new, and have never before
been expressed by man. And it is the source from
which such feelings flow of which the art of the upper
classes has deprived itself by estimating feelings, not in
conformity with religious perception, but according to
the degree of enjoyment they afford. There is nothing
older and more hackneyed than enjoyment, and there
is nothing fresher than the feelings springing from the
religious consciousness of each age. It could not be
otherwise: man's enjoyment has limits established by
his nature, but the movement forward of humanity, that
which is voiced by religious perception, has no limits.
At every forward step taken by humanity&mdash;and such
steps are taken in consequence of the greater and
greater elucidation of religious perception&mdash;men experience
new and fresh feelings. And therefore only
on the basis of religious perception (which shows the
highest level of life-comprehension reached by the men
of a certain period) can fresh emotion, never before felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
by man, arise. From the religious perception of the
ancient Greeks flowed the really new, important, and
endlessly varied feelings expressed by Homer and the
tragic writers. It was the same among the Jews, who
attained the religious conception of a single God,&mdash;from
that perception flowed all those new and important
emotions expressed by the prophets. It was the same
for the poets of the Middle Ages, who if they believed
in a heavenly hierarchy, believed also in the Catholic
commune; and it is the same for a man of to-day who
has grasped the religious conception of true Christianity,&mdash;the
brotherhood of man.</p>

<p>The variety of fresh feelings flowing from religious
perception is endless, and they are all new; for religious
perception is nothing else than the first indication of
that which is coming into existence, viz., the new relation
of man to the world around him. But the feelings
flowing from the desire for enjoyment are, on the contrary,
not only limited, but were long ago experienced
and expressed. And therefore the lack of belief of the
upper classes of Europe has left them with an art fed
on the poorest subject-matter.</p>

<p>The impoverishment of the subject-matter of upper-class
art was further increased by the fact that, ceasing
to be religious, it ceased also to be popular, and this again
diminished the range of feelings which it transmitted.
For the range of feelings experienced by the powerful
and the rich, who have no experience of labor for the
support of life, is far poorer, more limited, and more
insignificant than the range of feelings natural to working-people.</p>

<p>People of our circle, æstheticians, usually think and
say just the contrary of this. I remember how Gontchareff,
the author, a very clever and educated man, but
a thorough townsman and an æsthetician, said to me
that after Tourgenieff's "Memoirs of a Sportsman" there
was nothing left to write about in peasant life. It was
all used up. The life of working-people seemed to him
so simple that Tourgenieff's peasant stories had used
up all there was to describe. The life of our wealthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
people, with their love-affairs and dissatisfaction with
themselves, seemed to him full of inexhaustible subject-matter.
One hero kissed his lady on her palm, another
on her elbow, and a third somewhere else. One man
is discontented through idleness, and another because
people don't love him. And Gontchareff thought that
in this sphere there is no end of variety. And this
opinion&mdash;that the life of working-people is poor in
subject-matter, but that our life, the life of the idle, is
full of interest&mdash;is shared by very many people in our
society. The life of a laboring man, with its endlessly
varied forms of labor, and the dangers connected with
this labor on sea and underground; his migrations, the
intercourse with his employers, overseers, and companions,
and with men of other religions and other nationalities;
his struggles with nature and with wild beasts, the
associations with domestic animals, the work in the forest,
on the steppe, in the field, the garden, the orchard; his
intercourse with wife and children, not only as with
people near and dear to him, but as with co-workers
and helpers in labor, replacing him in time of need;
his concern in all economic questions, not as matters of
display or discussion, but as problems of life for himself
and his family; his pride in self-suppression and service
to others, his pleasures of refreshment; and with all
these interests permeated by a religious attitude toward
these occurrences&mdash;all this to us, who have not these
interests and possess no religious perception, seems
monotonous in comparison with those small enjoyments
and insignificant cares of our life,&mdash;a life, not of labor
nor of production, but of consumption and destruction
of that which others have produced for us. We think
the feelings experienced by people of our day and our
class are very important and varied; but in reality almost
all the feelings of people of our class amount to but
three very insignificant and simple feelings,&mdash;the feeling
of pride, the feeling of sexual desire, and the feeling
of weariness of life. These three feelings, with their
outgrowths, form almost the only subject-matter of the
art of the rich classes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span></p>

<p>At first, at the very beginning of the separation of the
exclusive art of the upper classes from universal art, its
chief subject-matter was the feeling of pride. It was
so at the time of the Renaissance and after it, when the
chief subject of works of art was the laudation of the
strong,&mdash;popes, kings, and dukes: odes and madrigals
were written in their honor, and they were extolled in
cantatas and hymns; their portraits were painted, and
their statues carved, in various adulatory ways. Next,
the element of sexual desire began more and more to
enter into art, and (with very few exceptions, and in
novels and dramas almost without exception) it has
now become an essential feature of every art-product
of the rich classes.</p>

<p>The third feeling transmitted by the art of the rich&mdash;that
of discontent with life&mdash;appeared yet later in
modern art. This feeling, which, at the commencement
of the present century, was expressed only by
exceptional men: by Byron, by Leopardi, and afterward
by Heine, has latterly become fashionable, and is
expressed by most ordinary and empty people. Most
justly does the French critic Doumic characterize the
works of the new writers: "<i>C'est la lassitude de vivre,
le mépris de l'époque présente, le regret d'un autre temps
aperçu à&nbsp;travers l'illusion de l'art, le goût du paradoxe,
le besoin de se singulariser, une aspiration de raffinés
vers la simplicité, l'adoration enfantine du merveilleux,
la séduction maladive de la rêverie, l'ébranlement des
nerfs,&mdash;surtout l'appel exaspéré de la sensualité</i>" ("Les
Jeunes," René Doumic).<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> And, as a matter of fact, of
these three feelings it is sensuality, the lowest (accessible
not only to all men, but even to all animals), which
forms the chief subject-matter of works of art of recent
times.</p>

<p>From Boccaccio to Marcel Prévost, all the novels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
poems, and verses invariably transmit the feeling of
sexual love in its different forms. Adultery is not only
the favorite, but almost the only theme of all the novels.
A performance is not a performance unless, under some
pretense, women appear with naked busts and limbs.
Songs and <i>romances</i>&mdash;all are expressions of lust, idealized
in various degrees.</p>

<p>A majority of the pictures by French artists represent
female nakedness in various forms. In recent
French literature there is hardly a page or a poem in
which nakedness is not described, and in which, relevantly
or irrelevantly, their favorite thought and word
<i>nu</i> is not repeated a couple of times. There is a certain
writer, René de Gourmond, who gets printed, and is
considered talented. To get an idea of the new writers,
I read his novel, "Les Chevaux de Diomède." It is a
consecutive and detailed account of the sexual connections
some gentleman had with various women. Every
page contains lust-kindling descriptions. It is the same
in Pierre Louÿs' book, "Aphrodite," which met with
success; it is the same in a book I lately chanced upon,
Huysmans' "Certains," and, with but few exceptions,
it is the same in all the French novels. They are all
the productions of people suffering from erotic mania.
And these people are evidently convinced that as their
whole life, in consequence of their diseased condition,
is concentrated on amplifying various sexual abominations,
therefore the life of all the world is similarly concentrated.
And these people, suffering from erotic
mania, are imitated throughout the whole artistic world
of Europe and America.</p>

<p>Thus in consequence of the lack of belief and the
exceptional manner of life of the wealthy classes, the
art of those classes became impoverished in its subject-matter,
and has sunk to the transmission of the feelings
of pride, discontent with life, and, above all, of sexual
desire.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>


<p>In consequence of their unbelief, the art of the upper
classes became poor in subject-matter. But besides that,
becoming continually more and more exclusive, it became
at the same time continually more and more
involved, affected, and obscure.</p>

<p>When a universal artist (such as were some of the
Grecian artists or the Jewish prophets) composed his
work, he naturally strove to say what he had to say
in such a manner that his production should be intelligible
to all men. But when an artist composed for a
small circle of people placed in exceptional conditions,
or even for a single individual and his courtiers,&mdash;for
popes, cardinals, kings, dukes, queens, or for a king's
mistress,&mdash;he naturally only aimed at influencing these
people, who were well known to him, and lived in
exceptional conditions familiar to him. And this was
an easier task, and the artist was involuntarily drawn to
express himself by allusions comprehensible only to the
initiated, and obscure to every one else. In the first
place, more could be said in this way; and secondly,
there is (for the initiated) even a certain charm in the
cloudiness of such a manner of expression. This method,
which showed itself both in euphemism and in mythological
and historical allusions, came more and more
into use, until it has, apparently, at last reached its
utmost limits in the so-called art of the Decadents. It
has come, finally, to this: that not only is haziness,
mysteriousness, obscurity, and exclusiveness (shutting
out the masses) elevated to the rank of a merit and
a condition of poetic art, but even incorrectness, indefiniteness,
and lack of eloquence are held in esteem.</p>

<p>Théophile Gautier, in his preface to the celebrated
"Fleurs du Mal," says that Baudelaire, as far as possible,
banished from poetry eloquence, passion, and truth
too strictly copied ("<i>l'éloquence, la passion, et la vérité
calquée trop exactement</i>").</p>

<p>And Baudelaire not only expressed this, but maintained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
his thesis in his verses, and yet more strikingly
in the prose of his "Petits Poèmes en Prose," the meanings
of which have to be guessed like a rebus, and
remain for the most part undiscovered.</p>

<p>The poet Verlaine (who followed next after Baudelaire,
and was also esteemed great) even wrote an "Art
Poétique," in which he advises this style of composition:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>De la musique avant toute chose</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Et pour cela préfère l'Impair</i><br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>And again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

<span class="i0"><i>De la musique encore et toujours!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Que ton vers soit la chose envolée</i><br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Et tout le reste est littérature.</i><a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span></p>
<p>After these two comes Mallarmé, considered the most
important of the young poets, and he plainly says that
the charm of poetry lies in our having to guess its
meaning&mdash;that in poetry there should always be a
puzzle:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Je pense qu'il faut qu'il n'y ait qu'allusion</i>, says he.
<i>La contemplation des objets, l'image s'envolant des rêveries
suscitées par eux, sont le chant: les Parnassiens,
eux, prennent la chose entièrement et la montrent; par
là ils manquent de mystère; ils retirent aux esprits cette
joie délicieuse de croire qu'ils créent.</i> Nommer un objet,
c'est supprimer les trois quarts de la jouissance du
poème, qui est faite du bonheur de deviner peu à peu:
le suggérer, voilà le rêve. <i>C'est le par fait usage de ce
mystère qui constitue le symbole: évoquer petit à petit
un objet pour montrer un état d'âme, ou, inversement,
choisir un objet et en dégager un état d'âme, par une sèrie
de déchiffrements.</i></p>

<p>.... <i>Si un être d'une intelligence moyenne, et d'une
préparation littéraire insuffisante, ouvre par hasard un
livre ainsi fait et prétend en jouir, il y a malentendu,
il faut remettre les choses à leur place.</i> Il doit y avoir
toujours énigme en poèsie, <i>et c'est le but de la littérature,
il n'y en a pas d'autre,&mdash;d'évoquer les objets</i>.&mdash;"Enquête
sur l'Évolution Littéraire," Jules Huret, pp. 60, 61.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span></p>
<p>Thus is obscurity elevated into a dogma among the
new poets. As the French critic Doumic (who has not
yet accepted the dogma) quite correctly says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Il serait temps aussi d'en finir avec cette fameuse
'théorie de l'obscurite' que la nouvelle école a élevée, en
effet, à la hauteur d'un dogme.</i>"&mdash;"Les Jeunes, par
René Doumic."<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>But it is not French writers only who think thus. The
poets of all other countries think and act in the same
way: German, and Scandinavian, and Italian, and Russian,
and English. So also do the artists of the new
period in all branches of art: in painting, in sculpture,
and in music. Relying on Nietzsche and Wagner, the
artists of the new age conclude that it is unnecessary
for them to be intelligible to the vulgar crowd; it is
enough for them to evoke poetic emotion in "the finest
nurtured," to borrow a phrase from an English æsthetician.</p>

<p>In order that what I am saying may not seem to be
mere assertion, I will quote at least a few examples from
the French poets who have led this movement. The
name of these poets is legion. I have taken French
writers, because they, more decidedly than any others,
indicate the new direction of art, and are imitated by
most European writers.</p>

<p>Besides those whose names are already considered
famous, such as Baudelaire and Verlaine, here are the
names of a few of them: Jean Moréas, Charles Morice,
Henri de Régnier, Charles Vignier, Adrien Remacle,
René Ghil, Maurice Maeterlinck, G. Albert Aurier, Rémy
de Gourmont, Saint-Pol-Roux-le-Magnifique, Georges
Rodenbach, le comte Robert de Montesquiou-Fezensac.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
These are Symbolists and Decadents. Next we have
the "Magi": Joséphin Péladan, Paul Adam, Jules Bois,
M. Papus, and others.</p>

<p>Besides these, there are yet one hundred and forty-one
others, whom Doumic mentions in the book referred to
above.</p>

<p>Here are some examples from the work of those of
them who are considered to be the best, beginning with
that most celebrated man, acknowledged to be a great
artist worthy of a monument&mdash;Baudelaire. This is a
poem from his celebrated "Fleurs du Mal":&mdash;</p>

<p>To be exact, I should mention that the collection contains
verses less comprehensible than these, but not one
poem which is plain and can be understood without a
certain effort&mdash;an effort seldom rewarded; for the feelings
which the poet transmits are evil and very low ones.
And these feelings are always, and purposely, expressed
by him with eccentricity and lack of clearness. This
premeditated obscurity is especially noticeable in his
prose, where the author could, if he liked, speak plainly.</p>

les merveilleux nuages!</i><a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The piece called "La Soupe et les Nuages" is probably
intended to express the unintelligibility of the poet even
to her whom he loves. This is the piece in question:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Ma petite folle bien-aimée me donnait à&nbsp;dîner, et par la
fenêtre ouverte de la salle à&nbsp;manger je contemplais les
mouvantes architectures que Dieu fait avec les vapeurs,
les merveilleuses constructions de l'impalpable. Et je me
disais, à travers ma contemplation: "Toutes ces fantasmagories
sont presque aussi belles que les yeux de ma belle
bien-aimée, la petite folle monstrueuse aux yeux verts."</i></p>

<p><i>Et tout à coup je reçus un violent coup de poing dans le
dos, et j'entendis une voix rauque et charmante, une voix
hystérique et comme enrouée par l'eau-de-vie, la voix de
ma chère petite bien-aimée, qui me disait, "Allez-vous
bientôt manger votre soupe, s.... b.... de marchand de
nuages?"</i><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>However artificial these two pieces may be, it is still
possible, with some effort, to guess at what the author
meant them to express, but some of the pieces are absolutely
incomprehensible&mdash;at least to me. "Le Galant
Tireur" is a piece I was quite unable to understand.</p>


<p class="center space-above"><i>LE GALANT TIREUR</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Comme la voiture traversait le bois, il la fit arrêter
dans le voisinage d'un tir, disant qu'il lui serait agréable
de tirer quelques balles pour tuer le Temps. Tuer ce
monstre-là, n'est-ce pas l'occupation la plus ordinaire et la
plus légitime de chacun?&mdash;Et il offrit galamment la
main à sa chère, délicieuse et exécrable femme, à cette
mystérieuse femme à laquelle il doit tant de plaisirs, tant
de douleurs, et peut-être aussi une grande partie de son
génie.</i></p>

<p><i>Plusieurs balles frappèrent loin du but proposè, l'une

maladresse de son époux, celui-ci se tourna brusquement
vers elle, et lui dit: "Observez cette poupée, là-bas, à

<p>The productions of another celebrity, Verlaine, are not
less affected and unintelligible. This, for instance, is
the first poem in the section called "Ariettes Oubliés."</p>

<p>How does the moon seem to live and die in a copper
heaven? And how can snow shine like sand? The
whole thing is not merely unintelligible, but, under pretense
of conveying an impression, it passes off a string
of incorrect comparisons and words.</p>

<p>Besides these artificial and obscure poems there are
others which are intelligible, but which make up for it by
being altogether bad, both in form and in subject. Such
are all the poems under the heading "La Sagesse." The
chief place in these verses is occupied by a very poor
expression of the most commonplace Roman Catholic
and patriotic sentiments. For instance, one meets with
verses such as this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Je ne veux plus penser qu'à&nbsp;ma mère Marie</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Siège de la sagesse et source de pardons</i>,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Before citing examples from other poets, I must pause
to note the amazing celebrity of these two versifiers,
Baudelaire and Verlaine, who are now accepted as being
great poets. How the French, who had Chénier, Musset,
Lamartine, and, above all, Hugo,&mdash;and among whom
quite recently flourished the so-called Parnassiens: Leconte
de Lisle, Sully-Prudhomme, etc.,&mdash;could attribute
such importance to these two versifiers, who were far
from skilful in form and most contemptible and commonplace
in subject-matter, is to me incomprehensible.
The conception of life of one of them, Baudelaire, consisted
in elevating gross egotism into a theory, and replacing
morality by a cloudy conception of beauty, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
especially artificial beauty. Baudelaire had a preference,
which he expressed, for a woman's face painted rather
than showing its natural color, and for metal trees and
a theatrical imitation of water rather than real trees and
real water.</p>

<p>The life-conception of the other, Verlaine, consisted
in weak profligacy, confession of his moral impotence,
and, as an antidote to that impotence, in the grossest
Roman Catholic idolatry. Both, moreover, were quite
lacking in naïveté, sincerity, and simplicity, and both
overflowed with artificiality, forced originality and self-assurance.
So that in their least bad productions one
sees more of M. Baudelaire or M. Verlaine than of what
they were describing. But these two indifferent versifiers
form a school, and lead hundreds of followers after
them.</p>

<p>There is only one explanation of this fact: it is that
the art of the society in which these versifiers lived is not
a serious, important matter of life, but is a mere amusement.
And all amusements grow wearisome by repetition.
And, in order to make wearisome amusement
again tolerable, it is necessary to find some means to
freshen it up. When, at cards, ombre grows stale, whist
is introduced; when whist grows stale, écarté is substituted;
when écarté grows stale, some other novelty is
invented, and so on. The substance of the matter remains
the same, only its form is changed. And so it is
with this kind of art. The subject-matter of the art of
the upper classes growing continually more and more
limited, it has come at last to this, that to the artists of
these exclusive classes it seems as if everything has
already been said, and that to find anything new to say
is impossible. And therefore, to freshen up this art,
they look out for fresh forms.</p>

<p>Baudelaire and Verlaine invent such a new form,
furbish it up, moreover, with hitherto unused pornographic
details, and&mdash;the critics and the public of the
upper classes hail them as great writers.</p>

<p>This is the only explanation of the success, not of
Baudelaire and Verlaine only, but of all the Decadents.</p>

<p>For instance, there are poems by Mallarmé and
Maeterlinck which have no meaning, and yet for all
that, or perhaps on that very account, are printed by
tens of thousands, not only in various publications, but
even in collections of the best works of the younger
poets.</p>

<p>This, for example, is a sonnet by Mallarmé:&mdash;</p>

<p>This poem is not exceptional in its incomprehensibility.
I have read several poems by Mallarmé, and
they also had no meaning whatever. I give a sample
of his prose in Appendix I. There is a whole volume
of this prose called "Divagations." It is impossible to
understand any of it. And that is evidently what the
author intended.</p>

<p>Who went out? Who came in? Who is speaking?
Who died?</p>

<p>I beg the reader to be at the pains of reading through
the samples I cite in Appendix II. of the celebrated
and esteemed young poets&mdash;Griffin, Verhaeren, Moréas,
and Montesquiou. It is important to do so in order to
form a clear conception of the present position of art,
and not to suppose, as many do, that Decadentism is an
accidental and transitory phenomenon. To avoid the
reproach of having selected the worst verses, I have
copied out of each volume the poem which happened
to stand on page 28.</p>

<p>All the other productions of these poets are equally
unintelligible, or can only be understood with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
difficulty, and then not fully. All the productions of
those hundreds of poets, of whom I have named a few,
are the same in kind. And among the Germans,
Swedes, Norwegians, Italians, and us Russians, similar
verses are printed. And such productions are printed
and made up into book form, if not by the million, then
by the hundred thousand (some of these works sell in
tens of thousands). For type-setting, paging, printing,
and binding these books, millions and millions of working
days are spent&mdash;not less, I think, than went to
build the great pyramid. And this is not all. The
same is going on in all the other arts: millions and
millions of working days are being spent on the production
of equally incomprehensible works in painting,
in music, and in the drama.</p>

<p>Painting not only does not lag behind poetry in this
matter, but rather outstrips it. Here is an extract from
the diary of an amateur of art, written when visiting
the Paris exhibitions in 1894:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I was to-day at three exhibitions: the Symbolists',
the Impressionists', and the Neo-Impressionists'. I
looked at the pictures conscientiously and carefully, but
again felt the same stupefaction and ultimate indignation.
The first exhibition, that of Camille Pissarro, was
comparatively the most comprehensible, though the pictures
were out of drawing, had no subject, and the colorings
were most improbable. The drawing was so
indefinite that you were sometimes unable to make out
which way an arm or a head was turned. The subject
was generally '<i>effets</i>'&mdash;<i>Effet de brouillard</i>, <i>Effet du
soir</i>, <i>Soleil couchant</i>. There were some pictures with
figures, but without subjects.</p>

<p>"In the coloring, bright blue and bright green predominated.
And each picture had its special color, with
which the whole picture was, as it were, splashed. For
instance, in 'A Girl Guarding Geese,' the special color
is <i>vert de gris</i>, and dots of it were splashed about everywhere;
on the face, the hair, the hands, and the clothes.
In the same gallery&mdash;'Durand Ruel'&mdash;were other pictures
by Puvis de Chavannes, Manet, Monet, Renoir,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
Sisley&mdash;who are all Impressionists. One of them,
whose name I could not make out,&mdash;it was something
like Redon,&mdash;had painted a blue face in profile. On
the whole face there is only this blue tone, with white-of-lead.
Pissarro has a water-color all done in dots. In
the foreground is a cow, entirely painted with various-colored
dots. The general color cannot be distinguished,
however much one stands back from, or draws near to,
the picture. From there I went to see the Symbolists.
I looked at them long without asking any one for an explanation,
trying to guess the meaning; but it is beyond
human comprehension. One of the first things to catch
my eye was a wooden <i>haut-relief</i>, wretchedly executed,
representing a woman (naked) who with both hands is
squeezing from her two breasts streams of blood. The
blood flows down, becoming lilac in color. Her hair
first descends, and then rises again, and turns into
trees. The figure is all colored yellow, and the hair is
brown.</p>

<p>"Next&mdash;a picture: a yellow sea, on which swims
something which is neither a ship nor a heart; on the
horizon is a profile with a halo and yellow hair, which
changes into a sea, in which it is lost. Some of the
painters lay on their colors so thickly that the effect is
something between painting and sculpture. A third
exhibit was even less comprehensible: a man's profile;
before him a flame and black stripes&mdash;leeches, as I was
afterwards told. At last I asked a gentleman who was
there what it meant, and he explained to me that the
<i>haut-relief</i> was a symbol, and that it represented '<i>La
Terre</i>.' The heart swimming in a yellow sea was '<i>Illusion
perdue</i>,' and the gentleman with the leeches '<i>Le
Mal</i>.' There were also some Impressionist pictures:
elementary profiles, holding some sort of flowers in
their hands: in monotone, out of drawing, and either
quite blurred or else marked out with wide black outlines."</p>

<p>This was in 1894; the same tendency is now even
more strongly defined, and we have Böcklin, Stuck,
Klinger, Sasha Schneider, and others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span></p>

<p>The same thing is taking place in the drama. The
play-writers give us an architect who, for some reason,
has not fulfilled his former high intentions, and who
consequently climbs on to the roof of a house he has
erected, and tumbles down head foremost; or an incomprehensible
old woman (who exterminates rats), and
who, for an unintelligible reason, takes a poetic child to
the sea, and there drowns him; or some blind men who,
sitting on the seashore, for some reason always repeat
one and the same thing; or a bell of some kind, which
flies into a lake, and there rings.</p>

<p>And the same is happening in music&mdash;in that art
which, more than any other, one would have thought,
should be intelligible to everybody.</p>

<p>An acquaintance of yours, a musician of repute, sits
down to the piano and plays you what he says is a new
composition of his own, or of one of the new composers.
You hear the strange, loud sounds, and admire the gymnastic
exercises performed by his fingers; and you see
that the performer wishes to impress upon you that the
sounds he is producing express various poetic strivings
of the soul. You see his intention, but no feeling whatever
is transmitted to you except weariness. The execution
lasts long, or at least it seems very long to you,
because you do not receive any clear impression, and
involuntarily you remember the words of Alphonse
Karr, "<i>Plus ça va vite, plus ça dure longtemps</i>."<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> And
it occurs to you that perhaps it is all a mystification;
perhaps the performer is trying you&mdash;just throwing his
hands and fingers wildly about the keyboard in the
hope that you will fall into the trap and praise him,
and then he will laugh and confess that he only wanted
to see if he could hoax you. But when at last the piece
does finish, and the perspiring and agitated musician
rises from the piano evidently anticipating praise, you
see that it was all done in earnest.</p>

<p>The same thing takes place at all the concerts, with
pieces by Liszt, Wagner, Berlioz, Brahms, and (newest
of all) Richard Strauss, and the numberless other composers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
of the new school, who unceasingly produce
opera after opera, symphony after symphony, piece
after piece.</p>

<p>The same is occurring in a domain in which it seemed
hard to be unintelligible,&mdash;in the sphere of novels and
short stories.</p>

<p>Read "Là Bas," by Huysmans, or some of Kipling's
short stories, or "L'Annonciateur," by Villiers de l'Isle
Adam in his "Contes Cruels," etc., and you will find
them not only "abscons" (to use a word adopted by the
new writers), but absolutely unintelligible both in form
and in substance. Such, again, is the work by E. Morel,
"Terre Promise," now appearing in the <i>Revue Blanche</i>,
and such are most of the new novels. The style is very
high-flown, the feelings seem to be most elevated, but
you can't make out what is happening, to whom it is
happening, and where it is happening. And such is
the bulk of the young art of our time.</p>

<p>People who grew up in the first half of this century,
admiring Goethe, Schiller, Musset, Hugo, Dickens,
Beethoven, Chopin, Raphael, da Vinci, Michael Angelo,
Delaroche, being unable to make head or tail of this
new art, simply attribute its productions to tasteless
insanity, and wish to ignore them. But such an attitude
toward this new art is quite unjustifiable, because,
in the first place, that art is spreading more and more,
and has already conquered for itself a firm position in
society, similar to the one occupied by the Romanticists
in the third decade of this century; and, secondly and
chiefly, because, if it is permissible to judge in this way
of the productions of the latest form of art, called by
us Decadent art, merely because we do not understand
it, then remember there are an enormous number of people,&mdash;all
the laborers, and many of the non-laboring
folk,&mdash;who, in just the same way, do not comprehend
those productions of art which we consider admirable:
the verses of our favorite artists&mdash;Goethe, Schiller, and
Hugo; the novels of Dickens, the music of Beethoven
and Chopin, the pictures of Raphael, Michael Angelo,
da Vinci, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span></p>

<p>If I have a right to think that great masses of people
do not understand and do not like what I consider undoubtedly
good because they are not sufficiently developed,
then I have no right to deny that perhaps the
reason why I cannot understand and cannot like the
new productions of art is merely that I am still insufficiently
developed to understand them. If I have a
right to say that I, and the majority of people who are
in sympathy with me, do not understand the productions
of the new art, simply because there is nothing in it to
understand, and because it is bad art, then, with just the
same right, the still larger majority, the whole laboring
mass, who do not understand what I consider admirable
art, can say that what I reckon as good art is bad art,
and there is nothing in it to understand.</p>

<p>I once saw the injustice of such condemnation of
the new art with especial clearness, when, in my
presence, a certain poet, who writes incomprehensible
verses, ridiculed incomprehensible music with gay
self-assurance; and, shortly afterwards, a certain musician,
who composes incomprehensible symphonies,
laughed at incomprehensible poetry with equal self-confidence.
I have no right, and no authority, to condemn
the new art on the ground that I (a man
educated in the first half of the century) do not understand
it; I can only say that it is incomprehensible
to me. The only advantage the art I acknowledge
has over the Decadent art, lies in the fact that the
art I recognize is comprehensible to a somewhat larger
number of people than the present-day art.</p>

<p>The fact that I am accustomed to a certain exclusive
art, and can understand it, but am unable to understand
another still more exclusive art, does not give
me a right to conclude that my art is the real true
art, and that the other one, which I do not understand,
is an unreal, a bad art. I can only conclude that art,
becoming ever more and more exclusive, has become
more and more incomprehensible to an ever increasing
number of people, and that, in this its progress
toward greater and greater incomprehensibility (on one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
level of which I am standing, with the art familiar to
me), it has reached a point where it is understood by
a very small number of the elect, and the number of
these chosen people is ever becoming smaller and
smaller.</p>

<p>As soon as ever the art of the upper classes separated
itself from universal art, a conviction arose that
art may be art and yet be incomprehensible to the
masses. And as soon as this position was admitted,
it had inevitably to be admitted also that art may be
intelligible only to the very smallest number of the
elect, and, eventually, to two, or to one, of our nearest
friends, or to oneself alone. Which is practically what
is being said by modern artists: "I create and understand
myself, and if any one does not understand me,
so much the worse for him."</p>

<p>The assertion that art may be good art, and at the
same time incomprehensible to a great number of people,
is extremely unjust, and its consequences are
ruinous to art itself; but at the same time it is so common
and has so eaten into our conceptions, that it is
impossible sufficiently to elucidate all the absurdity of
it.</p>

<p>Nothing is more common than to hear it said of reputed
works of art, that they are very good but very
difficult to understand. We are quite used to such
assertions, and yet to say that a work of art is good,
but incomprehensible to the majority of men, is the
same as saying of some kind of food that it is very
good, but that most people can't eat it. The majority
of men may not like rotten cheese or putrefying grouse&mdash;dishes
esteemed by people with perverted tastes;
but bread and fruit are only good when they please
the majority of men. And it is the same with art.
Perverted art may not please the majority of men, but
good art always pleases every one.</p>

<p>It is said that the very best works of art are such
that they cannot be understood by the mass, but are
accessible only to the elect who are prepared to understand
these great works. But if the majority of men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
do not understand, the knowledge necessary to enable
them to understand should be taught and explained
to them. But it turns out that there is no such knowledge,
that the works cannot be explained, and that
those who say the majority do not understand good
works of art, still do not explain those works, but only
tell us that, in order to understand them, one must
read, and see, and hear these same works over and
over again. But this is not to explain, it is only to
habituate! And people may habituate themselves to
anything, even to the very worst things. As people
may habituate themselves to bad food, to spirits, tobacco,
and opium, just in the same way they may
habituate themselves to bad art&mdash;and that is exactly
what is being done.</p>

<p>Moreover, it cannot be said that the majority of
people lack the taste to esteem the highest works of
art. The majority always have understood, and still
understand, what we also recognize as being the very
best art: the epic of Genesis, the gospel parables,
folk-legends, fairy-tales, and folk-songs, are understood
by all. How can it be that the majority has suddenly
lost its capacity to understand what is high in our
art?</p>

<p>Of a speech it may be said that it is admirable, but
incomprehensible to those who do not know the language
in which it is delivered. A speech delivered in
Chinese may be excellent, and may yet remain incomprehensible
to me if I do not know Chinese; but what
distinguishes a work of art from all other mental activity
is just the fact that its language is understood
by all, and that it infects all without distinction. The
tears and laughter of a Chinese infect me just as
the laughter and tears of a Russian; and it is the
same with painting and music and poetry, when it is
translated into a language I understand. The songs
of a Kirghiz or of a Japanese touch me, though in a
lesser degree than they touch a Kirghiz or a Japanese.
I am also touched by Japanese painting, Indian architecture,
and Arabian stories. If I am but little touched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
by a Japanese song and a Chinese novel, it is not that
I do not understand these productions, but that I know
and am accustomed to higher works of art. It is not
because their art is above me. Great works of art are
only great because they are accessible and comprehensible
to every one. The story of Joseph, translated
into the Chinese language, touches a Chinese. The
story of Sakya Muni touches us. And there are, and
must be, buildings, pictures, statues, and music of similar
power. So that, if art fails to move men, it cannot
be said that this is due to the spectators' or hearers'
lack of understanding; but the conclusion to be drawn
may and should be, that such art is either bad art, or
is not art at all.</p>

<p>Art is differentiated from activity of the understanding,
which demands preparation and a certain sequence
of knowledge (so that one cannot learn trigonometry
before knowing geometry), by the fact that it acts on
people independently of their state of development and
education, that the charm of a picture, sounds, or of
forms, infects any man whatever his plane of development.</p>

<p>The business of art lies just in this,&mdash;to make that
understood and felt which, in the form of an argument,
might be incomprehensible and inaccessible.
Usually it seems to the recipient of a truly artistic
impression that he knew the thing before but had
been unable to express it.</p>

<p>And such has always been the nature of good, supreme
art; the "Iliad," the "Odyssey," the stories of
Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph, the Hebrew prophets, the
psalms, the gospel parables, the story of Sakya Muni,
and the hymns of the Vedas: all transmit very elevated
feelings, and are nevertheless quite comprehensible
now to us, educated or uneducated, as they were
comprehensible to the men of those times, long ago,
who were even less educated than our laborers. People
talk about incomprehensibility; but if art is the
transmission of feelings flowing from man's religious
perception, how can a feeling be incomprehensible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
which is founded on religion, <i>i.e.</i> on man's relation
to God? Such art should be, and has actually always
been, comprehensible to everybody, because every man's
relation to God is one and the same. And therefore
the churches and the images in them were always
comprehensible to every one. The hindrance to understanding
the best and highest feelings (as is said in the
gospel) does not at all lie in deficiency of development
or learning, but, on the contrary, in false development
and false learning. A good and lofty work of art may
be incomprehensible, but not to simple, unperverted
peasant laborers (all that is highest is understood by
them)&mdash;it may be, and often is, unintelligible to
erudite, perverted people destitute of religion. And
this continually occurs in our society, in which the
highest feelings are simply not understood. For instance,
I know people who consider themselves most
refined, and who say that they do not understand the
poetry of love to one's neighbor, of self-sacrifice, or
of chastity.</p>

<p>So that good, great, universal, religious art may be
incomprehensible to a small circle of spoilt people, but
certainly not to any large number of plain men.</p>

<p>Art cannot be incomprehensible to the great masses
only because it is very good&mdash;as artists of our day are
fond of telling us. Rather we are bound to conclude
that this art is unintelligible to the great masses only
because it is very bad art, or even is not art at all. So
that the favorite argument (naïvely accepted by the
cultured crowd), that in order to feel art one has first
to understand it (which really only means habituate
oneself to it), is the truest indication that what we are
asked to understand by such a method is either very
bad, exclusive art, or is not art at all.</p>

<p>People say that works of art do not please the people
because they are incapable of understanding them.
But if the aim of works of art is to infect people with
the emotion the artist has experienced, how can one
talk about not understanding?</p>

<p>A man of the people reads a book, sees a picture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
hears a play or a symphony, and is touched by no feeling.
He is told that this is because he cannot understand.
People promise to let a man see a certain show;
he enters and sees nothing. He is told that this is because
his sight is not prepared for this show. But the
man well knows that he sees quite well, and if he does
not see what people promised to show him, he only concludes
(as is quite just) that those who undertook to
show him the spectacle have not fulfilled their engagement.
And it is perfectly just for a man who does feel
the influence of some works of art to come to this conclusion
concerning artists who do not, by their works,
evoke feeling in him. To say that the reason a man is
not touched by my art is because he is still too stupid,
besides being very self-conceited and also rude, is to
reverse the rôles, and for the sick to send the hale to
bed.</p>

<p>Voltaire said that "<i>Tous les genres sont bons, hors le
genre ennuyeux</i>;"<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> but with even more right one may
say of art that <i>Tous les genres sont bons, hors celui
qu'on ne comprend pas, or qui ne produit pas son effet</i>,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
for of what value is an article which fails to do that for
which it was intended?</p>

<p>Mark this above all: if only it be admitted that art
may be art and yet be unintelligible to any one of sound
mind, there is no reason why any circle of perverted
people should not compose works tickling their own
perverted feelings and comprehensible to no one but
themselves, and call it "art," as is actually being done
by the so-called Decadents.</p>

<p>The direction art has taken may be compared to
placing on a large circle other circles, smaller and
smaller, until a cone is formed, the apex of which is no
longer a circle at all. That is what has happened to
the art of our times.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>


<p>Becoming ever poorer and poorer in subject-matter,
and more and more unintelligible in form, the art of the
upper classes, in its latest productions, has even lost all
the characteristics of art, and has been replaced by imitations
of art. Not only has upper-class art, in consequence
of its separation from universal art, become
poor in subject-matter, and bad in form, <i>i.e.</i> ever more
and more unintelligible, it has, in course of time, ceased
even to be art at all, and has been replaced by counterfeits.</p>

<p>This has resulted from the following causes: Universal
art arises only when some one of the people, having
experienced a strong emotion, feels the necessity of
transmitting it to others. The art of the rich classes,
on the other hand, arises not from the artist's inner impulse,
but chiefly because people of the upper classes
demand amusement and pay well for it. They demand
from art the transmission of feelings that please them,
and this demand artists try to meet. But it is a very
difficult task; for people of the wealthy classes, spending
their lives in idleness and luxury, desire to be continually
diverted by art; and art, even the lowest,
cannot be produced at will, but has to generate spontaneously
in the artist's inner self. And therefore, to
satisfy the demands of people of the upper classes, artists
have had to devise methods of producing imitations
of art. And such methods have been devised.</p>

<p>These methods are those of (1) borrowing, (2) imitating,
(3) striking (effects), and (4) interesting.</p>

<p>The first method consists in borrowing whole subjects,
or merely separate features, from former works recognized
by every one as being poetical, and in so re-shaping
them, with sundry additions, that they should have
an appearance of novelty.</p>

<p>Such works, evoking in people of a certain class
memories of artistic feelings formerly experienced,
produce an impression similar to art, and, provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
only that they conform to other needful conditions,
they pass for art among those who seek for pleasure
from art. Subjects borrowed from previous works of
art are usually called poetical subjects. Objects and
people thus borrowed are called poetical objects and
people. Thus, in our circle, all sorts of legends, sagas,
and ancient traditions are considered poetical subjects.
Among poetical people and objects we reckon maidens,
warriors, shepherds, hermits, angels, devils of all sorts,
moonlight, thunder, mountains, the sea, precipices,
flowers, long hair, lions, lambs, doves, and nightingales.
In general, all those objects are considered poetical
which have been most frequently used by former artists
in their productions.</p>

<p>Some forty years ago a stupid but highly cultured&mdash;<i>ayant
beaucoup d'acquis</i>&mdash;lady (since deceased) asked
me to listen to a novel written by herself. It began
with a heroine who, in a poetic white dress, and with
poetically flowing hair, was reading poetry near some
water in a poetic wood. The scene was in Russia, but
suddenly from behind the bushes the hero appears,
wearing a hat with a feather <i>à la Guillaume Tell</i> (the
book specially mentioned this) and accompanied by two
poetical white dogs. The authoress deemed all this
highly poetical, and it might have passed muster if
only it had not been necessary for the hero to speak.
But as soon as the gentleman in the hat <i>à la Guillaume
Tell</i> began to converse with the maiden in the white
dress, it became obvious that the authoress had nothing
to say, but had merely been moved by poetic memories
of other works, and imagined that by ringing the changes
on those memories she could produce an artistic impression.
But an artistic impression, <i>i.e.</i> infection, is only
received when an author has, in the manner peculiar to
himself, experienced the feeling which he transmits, and
not when he passes on another man's feeling previously
transmitted to him. Such poetry from poetry cannot
infect people, it can only simulate a work of art, and
even that only to people of perverted æsthetic taste.
The lady in question being very stupid and devoid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
talent, it was at once apparent how the case stood; but
when such borrowing is resorted to by people who are
erudite and talented and have cultivated the technique
of their art, we get those borrowings from the Greek,
the antique, the Christian or mythological world which
have become so numerous, and which, particularly in our
day, continue to increase and multiply, and are accepted
by the public as works of art, if only the borrowings are
well mounted by means of the technique of the particular
art to which they belong.</p>

<p>As a characteristic example of such counterfeits of art
in the realm of poetry, take Rostand's "Princesse Lointaine,"
in which there is not a spark of art, but which
seems very poetical to many people, and probably also
to its author.</p>

<p>The second method of imparting a semblance of art
is that which I have called imitating. The essence of
this method consists in supplying details accompanying
the thing described or depicted. In literary art this
method consists in describing, in the minutest details,
the external appearance, the faces, the clothes, the
gestures, the tones, and the habitations of the characters
represented, with all the occurrences met with in life.
For instance, in novels and stories, when one of the
characters speaks, we are told in what voice he spoke,
and what he was doing at the time. And the things
said are not given so that they should have as much
sense as possible, but, as they are in life, disconnectedly,
and with interruptions and omissions. In dramatic art,
besides such imitation of real speech, this method consists
in having all the accessories and all the people just
like those in real life. In painting, this method assimilates
painting to photography, and destroys the difference
between them. And, strange to say, this method is used
also in music: music tries to imitate, not only by its
rhythm but also by its very sounds, the sounds which
in real life accompany the thing it wishes to represent.</p>

<p>The third method is by action, often purely physical,
on the outer senses. Work of this kind is said to be
"striking," "effectful." In all arts these effects consist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
chiefly in contrasts; in bringing together the terrible
and the tender, the beautiful and the hideous, the
loud and the soft, darkness and light, the most ordinary
and the most extraordinary. In verbal art, besides effects
of contrast, there are also effects consisting in the description
of things that have never before been described.
These are usually pornographic details evoking sexual
desire, or details of suffering and death evoking feelings
of horror, as, for instance, when describing a murder, to
give a detailed medical account of the lacerated tissues,
of the swellings, of the smell, quantity, and appearance
of the blood. It is the same in painting: besides all
kinds of other contrasts, one is coming into vogue which
consists in giving careful finish to one object and being
careless about all the rest. The chief and usual effects
in painting are effects of light and the depiction of the
horrible. In the drama, the most common effects, besides
contrasts, are tempests, thunder, moonlight, scenes
at sea or by the seashore, changes of costume, exposure
of the female body, madness, murders, and death generally:
the dying person exhibiting in detail all the
phases of agony. In music the most usual effects are a
<i>crescendo</i>, passing from the softest and simplest sounds
to the loudest and most complex crash of the full
orchestra; a repetition of the same sounds <i>arpeggio</i> in
all the octaves and on various instruments; or that the
harmony, tone, and rhythm be not at all those naturally
flowing from the course of the musical thought, but such
as strike one by their unexpectedness. Besides these,
the commonest effects in music are produced in a purely
physical manner by strength of sound, especially in an
orchestra.</p>

<p>Such are some of the most usual effects in the various
arts, but there yet remains one common to them all;
namely, to convey by means of one art what it would be
natural to convey by another: for instance, to make
music describe (as is done by the programme music of
Wagner and his followers), or to make painting, the
drama, or poetry, induce a frame of mind (as is aimed
at by all the Decadent art).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span></p>

<p>The fourth method is that of interesting (that is,
absorbing the mind) in connection with works of art.
The interest may lie in an intricate plot&mdash;a method till
quite recently much employed in English novels and
French plays, but now going out of fashion and being
replaced by authenticity, <i>i.e.</i> by detailed description of
some historical period or some branch of contemporary
life. For example, in a novel, interestingness may consist
in a description of Egyptian or Roman life, the life
of miners, or that of the clerks in a large shop. The
reader becomes interested and mistakes this interest for
an artistic impression. The interest may also depend on
the very method of expression; a kind of interest that
has now come much into use. Both verse and prose, as
well as pictures, plays, and music, are constructed so that
they must be guessed like riddles, and this process of
guessing again affords pleasure and gives a semblance
of the feeling received from art.</p>

<p>It is very often said that a work of art is very good
because it is poetic, or realistic, or striking, or interesting;
whereas not only can neither the first, nor the
second, nor the third, nor the fourth of these attributes
supply a standard of excellence in art, but they have not
even anything in common with art.</p>

<p>Poetic&mdash;means borrowed. All borrowing merely
recalls to the reader, spectator, or listener some dim
recollection of artistic impressions they have received
from previous works of art, and does not infect them
with feeling which the artist has himself experienced.
A work founded on something borrowed, like Goethe's
"Faust," for instance, may be very well executed and
be full of mind and every beauty, but because it lacks
the chief characteristic of a work of art&mdash;completeness,
oneness, the inseparable unity of form and contents
expressing the feeling the artist has experienced&mdash;it
cannot produce a really artistic impression. In availing
himself of this method, the artist only transmits the
feeling received by him from a previous work of art;
therefore every borrowing, whether it be of whole subjects,
or of various scenes, situations, or descriptions, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
but a reflection of art, a simulation of it, but not art
itself. And therefore, to say that a certain production
is good because it is poetic&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> resembles a work of
art&mdash;is like saying of a coin that it is good because it
resembles real money.</p>

<p>Equally little can imitation, realism, serve, as many
people think, as a measure of the quality of art. Imitation
cannot be such a measure; for the chief characteristic
of art is the infection of others with the feelings the
artist has experienced, and infection with a feeling is
not only not identical with description of the accessories
of what is transmitted, but is usually hindered by superfluous
details. The attention of the receiver of the
artistic impression is diverted by all these well-observed
details, and they hinder the transmission of feeling even
when it exists.</p>

<p>To value a work of art by the degree of its realism,
by the accuracy of the details reproduced, is as strange
as to judge of the nutritive quality of food by its external
appearance. When we appraise a work according
to its realism, we only show that we are talking, not of
a work of art, but of its counterfeit.</p>

<p>Neither does the third method of imitating art&mdash;by
the use of what is striking or effectual&mdash;coincide with
real art any better than the two former methods; for in
effectfulness&mdash;the effects of novelty, of the unexpected,
of contrasts, of the horrible&mdash;there is no transmission
of feeling, but only an action on the nerves. If an
artist were to paint a bloody wound admirably, the sight
of the wound would strike me, but it would not be art.
One prolonged note on a powerful organ will produce
a striking impression, will often even cause tears, but
there is no music in it, because no feeling is transmitted.
Yet such physiological effects are constantly mistaken
for art by people of our circle, and this not only in
music, but also in poetry, painting, and the drama. It
is said that art has become refined. On the contrary,
thanks to the pursuit of effectfulness, it has become
very coarse. A new piece is brought out and accepted
all over Europe, such, for instance, as "Hannele," in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
which play the author wishes to transmit to the spectators
pity for a persecuted girl. To evoke this feeling
in the audience by means of art, the author should
either make one of the characters express this pity in
such a way as to infect every one, or he should describe
the girl's feelings correctly. But he cannot, or will not,
do this, and chooses another way, more complicated in
stage management, but easier for the author. He makes
the girl die on the stage; and, still further to increase
the physiological effect on the spectators, he extinguishes
the lights in the theater, leaving the audience in the
dark, and to the sound of dismal music he shows how
the girl is pursued and beaten by her drunken father.
The girl shrinks&mdash;screams&mdash;groans&mdash;and falls.
Angels appear and carry her away. And the audience,
experiencing some excitement while this is going on,
are fully convinced that this is true æsthetic feeling.
But there is nothing æsthetic in such excitement; for
there is no infecting of man by man, but only a mingled
feeling of pity for another, and of self-congratulation
that it is not I who am suffering: it is like what we
feel at the sight of an execution, or what the Romans
felt in their circuses.</p>

<p>The substitution of effectfulness for æsthetic feeling
is particularly noticeable in musical art&mdash;that art which
by its nature has an immediate physiological action on
the nerves. Instead of transmitting by means of a melody
the feelings he has experienced, a composer of the
new school accumulates and complicates sounds, and
by now strengthening, now weakening them, he produces
on the audience a physiological effect of a kind
that can be measured by an apparatus invented for the
purpose.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> And the public mistake this physiological
effect for the effect of art.</p>

<p>As to the fourth method&mdash;that of interesting&mdash;it also
is frequently confounded with art. One often hears it
said, not only of a poem, a novel, or a picture, but even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
of a musical work, that it is interesting. What does
this mean? To speak of an interesting work of art
means either that we receive from a work of art information
new to us, or that the work is not fully intelligible,
and that little by little, and with effort, we arrive at its
meaning, and experience a certain pleasure in this process
of guessing it. In neither case has the interest anything
in common with artistic impression. Art aims at
infecting people with feeling experienced by the artist.
But the mental effort necessary to enable the spectator,
listener, or reader to assimilate the new information contained
in the work, or to guess the puzzles propounded,
by distracting him, hinders the infection. And therefore
the interestingness of a work, not only has nothing
to do with its excellence as a work of art, but rather
hinders than assists artistic impression.</p>

<p>We may, in a work of art, meet with what is poetic,
and realistic, and striking, and interesting, but these
things cannot replace the essential of art,&mdash;feeling experienced
by the artist. Latterly, in upper-class art,
most of the objects given out as being works of art are
of the kind which only resemble art, and are devoid of
its essential quality,&mdash;feeling experienced by the artist.
And, for the diversion of the rich, such objects are continually
being produced in enormous quantities by the
artisans of art.</p>

<p>Many conditions must be fulfilled to enable a man to
produce a real work of art. It is necessary that he
should stand on the level of the highest life-conception
of his time, that he should experience feeling and have
the desire and capacity to transmit it, and that he should,
moreover, have a talent for some one of the forms of
art. It is very seldom that all these conditions necessary
to the production of true art are combined. But
in order&mdash;aided by the customary methods of borrowing,
imitating, introducing effects, and interesting&mdash;unceasingly
to produce counterfeits of art which pass
for art in our society and are well paid for, it is only
necessary to have a talent for some branch of art; and
this is very often to be met with. By talent I mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
ability: in literary art, the ability to express one's
thoughts and impressions easily and to notice and remember
characteristic details; in the depictive arts, to
distinguish and remember lines, forms, and colors; in
music, to distinguish the intervals, and to remember and
transmit the sequence of sounds. And a man, in our
times, if only he possesses such a talent and selects
some specialty, may, after learning the methods of
counterfeiting used in his branch of art,&mdash;if he has
patience and if his æsthetic feeling (which would render
such productions revolting to him) be atrophied,&mdash;unceasingly,
till the end of his life, turn out works which
will pass for art in our society.</p>

<p>To produce such counterfeits, definite rules or recipes
exist in each branch of art. So that the talented man,
having assimilated them, may produce such works <i>à
froid</i>, cold drawn, without any feeling.</p>

<p>In order to write poems a man of literary talent needs
only these qualifications: to acquire the knack, conformably
with the requirements of rhyme and rhythm,
of using, instead of the one really suitable word, ten
others meaning approximately the same; to learn how
to take any phrase which, to be clear, has but one
natural order of words, and despite all possible dislocations
still to retain some sense in it; and lastly, to
be able, guided by the words required for the rhymes,
to devise some semblance of thoughts, feelings, or
descriptions to suit these words. Having acquired these
qualifications, he may unceasingly produce poems&mdash;short
or long, religious, amatory, or patriotic, according
to the demand.</p>

<p>If a man of literary talent wishes to write a story
or novel, he need only form his style&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> learn how
to describe all that he sees&mdash;and accustom himself to
remember or note down details. When he has accustomed
himself to this, he can, according to his inclination
or the demand, unceasingly produce novels or
stories&mdash;historical, naturalistic, social, erotic, psychological,
or even religious, for which latter kind a demand
and fashion begins to show itself. He can take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
subjects from books or from the events of life, and can
copy the characters of the people in his book from his
acquaintances.</p>

<p>And such novels and stories, if only they are decked
out with well-observed and carefully noted details, preferably
erotic ones, will be considered works of art,
even though they may not contain a spark of feeling
experienced.</p>

<p>To produce art in dramatic form, a talented man, in
addition to all that is required for novels and stories,
must also learn to furnish his characters with as many
smart and witty sentences as possible, must know how
to utilize theatrical effects, and how to entwine the
action of his characters so that there should not be any
long conversations, but as much bustle and movement
on the stage as possible. If the writer is able to do
this, he may produce dramatic works one after another
without stopping, selecting his subjects from the reports
of the law courts, or from the latest society topic,
such as hypnotism, heredity, etc., or from deep antiquity,
or even from the realms of fancy.</p>

<p>In the sphere of painting and sculpture it is still
easier for the talented man to produce imitations of
art. He need only learn to draw, paint, and model&mdash;especially
naked bodies. Thus equipped he can continue
to paint pictures, or model statues, one after
another, choosing subjects according to his bent&mdash;mythological,
or religious, or fantastic, or symbolical;
or he may depict what is written about in the papers&mdash;a
coronation, a strike, the Turko-Grecian war, famine
scenes; or, commonest of all, he may just copy anything
he thinks beautiful&mdash;from naked women to
copper basins.</p>

<p>For the production of musical art the talented man
needs still less of what constitutes the essence of art,
<i>i.e.</i> feeling wherewith to infect others: but on the other
hand, he requires more physical, gymnastic labor than
for any other art, unless it be dancing. To produce
works of musical art, he must first learn to move his
fingers on some instrument as rapidly as those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
have reached the highest perfection; next, he must
know how in former times polyphonic music was written,
must study what are called counterpoint and fugue;
and, furthermore, he must learn orchestration, <i>i.e.</i> how
to utilize the effects of the instruments. But once he
has learned all this, the composer may unceasingly
produce one work after another; whether programme-music,
opera, or song (devising sounds more or less
corresponding to the words), or chamber music, <i>i.e.</i> he
may take another man's themes and work them up into
definite forms by means of counterpoint and fugue; or,
what is commonest of all, he may compose fantastic
music, <i>i.e.</i> he may take a conjunction of sounds which
happens to come to hand, and pile every sort of complication
and ornamentation on to this chance combination.</p>

<p>Thus, in all realms of art, counterfeits of art are
manufactured to a ready-made, prearranged recipe, and
these counterfeits the public of our upper classes accept
for real art.</p>

<p>And this substitution of counterfeits for real works
of art was the third and most important consequence
of the separation of the art of the upper classes from
universal art.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>


<p>In our society three conditions coöperate to cause the
production of objects of counterfeit art. They are&mdash;(1)
the considerable remuneration of artists for their
productions, and the professionalization of artists which
this has produced, (2) art criticism, and (3) schools of
art.</p>

<p>While art was as yet undivided, and only religious
art was valued and rewarded while indiscriminate art
was left unrewarded, there were no counterfeits of art,
or, if any existed, being exposed to the criticism of the
whole people, they quickly disappeared. But as soon
as that division occurred, and the upper classes acclaaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
every kind of art as good if only it afforded
them pleasure, and began to reward such art more
highly than any other social activity, immediately a
large number of people devoted themselves to this
activity, and art assumed quite a different character,
and became a profession.</p>

<p>And as soon as this occurred, the chief and most
precious quality of art&mdash;its sincerity&mdash;was at once
greatly weakened and eventually quite destroyed.</p>

<p>The professional artist lives by his art, and has continually
to invent subjects for his works, and does invent
them. And it is obvious how great a difference
must exist between works of art produced on the one
hand by men such as the Jewish prophets, the authors
of the Psalms, Francis of Assisi, the authors of the
"Iliad" and "Odyssey," of folk-stories, legends, and folk-songs,
many of whom not only received no remuneration
for their work, but did not even attach their names to
it; and, on the other hand, works produced by court
poets, dramatists and musicians receiving honors and
remuneration; and later on by professional artists, who
lived by the trade, receiving remuneration from newspaper
editors, publishers, impresarios, and in general
from those agents who come between the artists and
the town public&mdash;the consumers of art.</p>

<p>Professionalism is the first condition of the diffusion
of false, counterfeit art.</p>

<p>The second condition is the growth, in recent times,
of artistic criticism, <i>i.e.</i> the valuation of art, not by everybody,
and, above all, not by plain men, but by erudite,
that is, by perverted and at the same time self-confident
individuals.</p>

<p>A friend of mine, speaking of the relation of critics to
artists, half jokingly defined it thus: "Critics are the
stupid who discuss the wise." However partial, inexact,
and rude this definition may be, it is yet partly true, and
is incomparably juster than the definition which considers
critics to be men who can explain works of art.</p>

<p>"Critics explain!" What do they explain?</p>

<p>The artist, if a real artist, has by his work transmitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
to others the feeling he experienced. What is there,
then, to explain?</p>

<p>If a work be good as art, then the feeling expressed
by the artist&mdash;be it moral or immoral&mdash;transmits itself
to other people. If transmitted to others, then they feel
it, and all interpretations are superfluous. If the work
does not infect people, no explanation can make it contagious.
An artist's work cannot be interpreted. Had
it been possible to explain in words what he wished to
convey, the artist would have expressed himself in words.
He expressed it by his art only because the feeling he
experienced could not be otherwise transmitted. The
interpretation of works of art by words only indicates
that the interpreter is himself incapable of feeling the
infection of art. And this is actually the case; for, however
strange it may seem to say so, critics have always
been people less susceptible than other men to the contagion
of art. For the most part they are able writers,
educated and clever, but with their capacity of being
infected by art quite perverted or atrophied. And therefore
their writings have always largely contributed, and
still contribute, to the perversion of the taste of that
public which reads them and trusts them.</p>

<p>Artistic criticism did not exist&mdash;could not and cannot
exist&mdash;in societies where art is undivided, and where,
consequently, it is appraised by the religious understanding
of life common to the whole people. Art criticism
grew, and could grow, only on the art of the upper
classes, who did not acknowledge the religious perception
of their time.</p>

<p>Universal art has a definite and indubitable internal
criterion,&mdash;religious perception; upper-class art lacks
this, and therefore the appreciators of that art are
obliged to cling to some external criterion. And they
find it in "the judgments of the finest-nurtured," as an
English æsthetician has phrased it, that is, in the authority
of the people who are considered educated, nor
in this alone, but also in a tradition of such authorities.
This tradition is extremely misleading, both because the
opinions of "the finest-nurtured" are often mistaken,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
and also because judgments which were valid once cease
to be so with the lapse of time. But the critics, having
no basis for their judgments, never cease to repeat their
traditions. The classical tragedians were once considered
good, and therefore criticism considers them to
be so still. Dante was esteemed a great poet, Raphael
a great painter, Bach a great musician&mdash;and the critics,
lacking a standard by which to separate good art from
bad, not only consider these artists great, but regard all
their productions as admirable and worthy of imitation.
Nothing has contributed, and still contributes, so much
to the perversion of art as these authorities set up by
criticism. A man produces a work of art, like every
true artist expressing in his own peculiar manner a
feeling he has experienced. Most people are infected
by the artist's feeling; and his work becomes known.
Then criticism, discussing the artist, says that the work
is not bad, but all the same the artist is not a Dante, nor
a Shakespear, nor a Goethe, nor a Raphael, nor what
Beethoven was in his last period. And the young artist
sets to work to copy those who are held up for his imitation,
and he produces not only feeble works, but false
works,&mdash;counterfeits of art.</p>

<p>Thus, for instance, our Pushkin writes his short poems,
"Evgeniy Onegin," "The Gipsies," and his stories&mdash;works
all varying in quality, but all true art. But then,
under the influence of false criticism extolling Shakespear,
he writes "Boris Godunoff," a cold, brain-spun
work, and this production is lauded by the critics, set up
as a model, and imitations of it appear: "Minin," by
Ostrovsky, and "Tsar Boris," by Alexée Tolstoï, and
such imitations of imitations as crowd all literatures
with insignificant productions. The chief harm done by
the critics is this,&mdash;that themselves lacking the capacity
to be infected by art (and that is the characteristic of all
critics; for did they not lack this they could not attempt
the impossible&mdash;the interpretation of works of art), they
pay most attention to, and eulogize, brain-spun, invented
works, and set these up as models worthy of imitation.
That is the reason they so confidently extol, in literature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
the Greek tragedians, Dante, Tasso, Milton, Shakespear,
Goethe (almost all he wrote), and, among recent writers,
Zola and Ibsen; in music, Beethoven's last period, and
Wagner. To justify their praise of these brain-spun,
invented works, they devise entire theories (of which the
famous theory of beauty is one); and not only dull but
also talented people compose works in strict deference
to these theories; and often even real artists, doing
violence to their genius, submit to them.</p>

<p>Every false work extolled by the critics serves as a
door through which the hypocrites of art at once
crowd in.</p>

<p>It is solely due to the critics, who in our times still praise
rude, savage, and, for us, often meaningless works of the
ancient Greeks: Sophocles, Euripides, Æschylus, and
especially Aristophanes; or, of modern writers, Dante,
Tasso, Milton, Shakespear; in painting, all of Raphael,
all of Michael Angelo, including his absurd "Last Judgment";
in music, the whole of Bach, and the whole of
Beethoven, including his last period,&mdash;thanks only to
them have the Ibsens, Maeterlincks, Verlaines, Mallarmés,
Puvis de Chavannes, Klingers, Böcklins, Stucks,
Schneiders; in music, the Wagners, Liszts, Berliozes,
Brahmses, and Richard Strausses, etc., and all that immense
mass of good-for-nothing imitators of these imitators,
become possible in our day.</p>

<p>As a good illustration of the harmful influence of
criticism, take its relation to Beethoven. Among his
innumerable hasty productions written to order, there
are, notwithstanding their artificiality of form, works of
true art. But he grows deaf, cannot hear, and begins to
write invented, unfinished works, which are consequently
often meaningless and musically unintelligible. I know
that musicians can imagine sounds vividly enough, and
can almost hear what they read, but imaginary sounds
can never replace real ones, and every composer must
hear his production in order to perfect it. Beethoven,
however, could not hear, could not perfect his work,
and consequently published productions which are artistic
ravings. But criticism, having once acknowledged him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
to be a great composer, seizes on just these abnormal works
with special gusto, and searches for extraordinary beauties
in them. And, to justify its laudations (perverting the
very meaning of musical art), it attributed to music the
property of describing what it cannot describe. And
imitators appear&mdash;an innumerable host of imitators of
these abnormal attempts at artistic productions which
Beethoven wrote when he was deaf.</p>

<p>Then Wagner appears, who at first in critical articles
praises just Beethoven's last period, and connects this
music with Schopenhauer's mystical theory that music
is the expression of Will&mdash;not of separate manifestations
of will objectivized on various planes, but its very
essence&mdash;which is in itself as absurd as this music
of Beethoven. And afterward he composes music of
his own on this theory, in conjunction with another still
more erroneous system of the union of all the arts.
After Wagner yet new imitators appear, diverging yet
further from art: Brahms, Richard Strauss, and others.</p>

<p>Such are the results of criticism. But the third
condition of the perversion of art, namely, art schools,
is almost more harmful still.</p>

<p>As soon as art became, not art for the whole people,
but for a rich class, it became a profession; as soon as
it became a profession, methods were devised to teach
it; people who chose this profession of art began to
learn these methods, and thus professional schools
sprang up: classes of rhetoric or literature in the public
schools, academies for painting, conservatoires for
music, schools for dramatic art.</p>

<p>In these schools art is taught! But art is the transmission
to others of a special feeling experienced by
the artist. How can this be taught in schools?</p>

<p>No school can evoke feeling in a man, and still less
can it teach him how to manifest it in the one particular
manner natural to him alone. But the essence of art
lies in these things.</p>

<p>The one thing these schools can teach is how to
transmit feelings experienced by other artists in the
way those other artists transmitted them. And this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
just what the professional schools do teach; and such
instruction not only does not assist the spread of true
art, but, on the contrary, by diffusing counterfeits of
art, does more than anything else to deprive people
of the capacity to understand true art.</p>

<p>In literary art people are taught how, without having
anything they wish to say, to write a many-paged composition
on a theme about which they have never thought,
and, moreover, to write it so that it should resemble the
work of an author admitted to be celebrated. This is
taught in schools.</p>

<p>In painting, the chief training consists in learning to
draw and paint from copies and models, the naked body
chiefly (the very thing that is never seen, and which
a man occupied with real art hardly ever has to depict),
and to draw and paint as former masters drew and
painted. The composition of pictures is taught by giving
out themes similar to those which have been treated
by former acknowledged celebrities.</p>

<p>So also in dramatic schools, the pupils are taught to
recite monologues just as tragedians, considered celebrated,
declaimed them.</p>

<p>It is the same in music. The whole theory of music
is nothing but a disconnected repetition of those methods
which the acknowledged masters of composition made
use of.</p>

<p>I have elsewhere quoted the profound remark of the
Russian artist Bruloff on art, but I cannot here refrain
from repeating it, because nothing better illustrates
what can and what cannot be taught in the schools.
Once when correcting a pupil's study, Bruloff just
touched it in a few places, and the poor dead study
immediately became animated. "Why, you only touched
it a <i>wee bit</i>, and it is quite another thing!" said one of
the pupils. "Art begins where the <i>wee bit</i> begins," replied
Bruloff, indicating by these words just what is most
characteristic of art. The remark is true of all the arts,
but its justice is particularly noticeable in the performance
of music. That musical execution should be
artistic, should be art, <i>i.e.</i> should infect, three chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
conditions must be observed,&mdash;there are many others
needed for musical perfection; the transition from one
sound to another must be interrupted or continuous;
the sound must increase or diminish steadily;
it must be blended with one and not with another
sound; the sound must have this or that timbre, and
much besides,&mdash;but take the three chief conditions;
the pitch, the time, and the strength of the sound.
Musical execution is only then art, only then infects,
when the sound is neither higher nor lower than it should
be, that is, when exactly the infinitely small center of
the required note is taken; when that note is continued
exactly as long as is needed; and when the strength of
the sound is neither more nor less than is required.
The slightest deviation of pitch in either direction, the
slightest increase or decrease in time, or the slightest
strengthening or weakening of the sound beyond what
is needed, destroys the perfection and, consequently,
the infectiousness of the work. So that the feeling of
infection by the art of music, which seems so simple
and so easily obtained, is a thing we receive only when
the performer finds those infinitely minute degrees
which are necessary to perfection in music. It is the
same in all arts: a wee bit lighter, a wee bit darker,
a wee bit higher, lower, to the right or the left&mdash;in
painting; a wee bit weaker or stronger in intonation,
or a wee bit sooner or later&mdash;in dramatic art; a
wee bit omitted, over-emphasized, or exaggerated&mdash;in
poetry, and there is no contagion. Infection is only
obtained when an artist finds those infinitely minute
degrees of which a work of art consists, and only to the
extent to which he finds them. And it is quite impossible
to teach people by external means to find these
minute degrees; they can only be found when a man
yields to his feeling. No instruction can make a dancer
catch just the tact of the music, or a singer or a fiddler
take exactly the infinitely minute center of his note,
or a sketcher draw of all possible lines the only right
one, or a poet find the only meet arrangement of the
only suitable words. All this is found only by feeling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
And therefore schools may teach what is necessary in
order to produce something resembling art, but not art
itself.</p>

<p>The teaching of the schools stops there where the <i>wee
bit</i> begins&mdash;consequently where art begins.</p>

<p>Accustoming people to something resembling art, disaccustoms
them to the comprehension of real art. And
that is how it comes about that none are more dull to
art than those who have passed through the professional
schools and been most successful in them. Professional
schools produce an hypocrisy of art precisely akin to
that hypocrisy of religion which is produced by theological
colleges for training priests, pastors, and religious
teachers generally. As it is impossible in a school to
train a man so as to make a religious teacher of him,
so it is impossible to teach a man how to become an
artist.</p>

<p>Art schools are thus doubly destructive of art: first, in
that they destroy the capacity to produce real art in those
who have the misfortune to enter them and go through
a seven or eight years' course; secondly, in that they
generate enormous quantities of that counterfeit art
which perverts the taste of the masses and overflows our
world. In order that born artists may know the methods
of the various arts elaborated by former artists, there
should exist in all elementary schools such classes for
drawing and music (singing) that, after passing through
them, every talented scholar may, by using existing
models accessible to all, be able to perfect himself in
his art independently.</p>

<p>These three conditions&mdash;the professionalization of
artists, art criticism, and art schools&mdash;have had this
effect: that most people in our times are quite unable
even to understand what art is, and accept as art the
grossest counterfeits of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>


<p>To what an extent people of our circle and time have lost
the capacity to receive real art, and have become accustomed
to accept as art things that have nothing in common
with it, is best seen from the works of Richard
Wagner, which have latterly come to be more and more
esteemed, not only by the Germans, but also by the
French and the English, as the very highest art, revealing
new horizons to us.</p>

<p>The peculiarity of Wagner's music, as is known, consists
in this,&mdash;that he considered that music should serve
poetry, expressing all the shades of a poetical work.</p>

<p>The union of the drama with music, devised in the
fifteenth century in Italy for the revival of what they
imagined to have been the ancient Greek drama with
music, is an artificial form which had, and has, success
only among the upper classes, and that only when gifted
composers, such as Mozart, Weber, Rossini, and others,
drawing inspiration from a dramatic subject, yielded
freely to the inspiration and subordinated the text to the
music, so that in their operas the important thing to the
audience was merely the music on a certain text, and
not the text at all, which latter, even when it was utterly
absurd, as, for instance, in the "Magic Flute," still
did not prevent the music from producing an artistic
impression.</p>

<p>Wagner wishes to correct the opera by letting music
submit to the demands of poetry and unite with it. But
each art has its own definite realm, which is not identical
with the realm of other arts, but merely comes in
contact with them; and therefore, if the manifestation
of, I will not say several, but even of two arts&mdash;the
dramatic and the musical&mdash;be united in one complete
production, then the demands of the one art will make
it impossible to fulfil the demands of the other, as has
always occurred in the ordinary operas, where the dramatic
art has submitted to, or rather yielded place to,
the musical. Wagner wishes that musical art should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
submit to dramatic art, and that both should appear in
full strength. But this is impossible; for every work of
art, if it be a true one, is an expression of intimate feelings
of the artist, which are quite exceptional, and not
like anything else. Such is a musical production, and
such is a dramatic work, if they be true art. And therefore,
in order that a production in the one branch of
art should coincide with a production in the other
branch, it is necessary that the impossible should happen:
that two works from different realms of art should
be absolutely exceptional, unlike anything that existed
before, and yet should coincide, and be exactly alike.</p>

<p>And this cannot be, just as there cannot be two men,
or even two leaves on a tree, exactly alike. Still less
can two works from different realms of art, the musical
and the literary, be absolutely alike. If they coincide,
then either one is a work of art and the other a counterfeit,
or both are counterfeits. Two live leaves cannot
be exactly alike, but two artificial leaves may be. And
so it is with works of art. They can only coincide completely
when neither the one nor the other is art, but
only cunningly devised semblances of it.</p>

<p>If poetry and music may be joined, as occurs in hymns,
songs, and <i>romances</i>&mdash;(though even in these the music
does not follow the changes of each verse of the text, as
Wagner wants to, but the song and the music merely
produce a coincident effect on the mind)&mdash;this occurs
only because lyrical poetry and music have, to some extent,
one and the same aim: to produce a mental condition
and the conditions produced by lyrical poetry and
by music can, more or less, coincide. But even in these
conjunctions the center of gravity always lies in one of
the two productions, so that it is one of them that produces
the artistic impression while the other remains unregarded.
And still less is it possible for such union to
exist between epic or dramatic poetry and music.</p>

<p>Moreover, one of the chief conditions of artistic creation
is the complete freedom of the artist from every kind
of preconceived demand. And the necessity of adjusting
his musical work to a work from another realm of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
art is a preconceived demand of such a kind as to destroy
all possibility of creative power; and therefore works of
this kind, adjusted to one another, are, and must be, as
has always happened, not works of art, but only imitations
of art, like the music of a melodrama, signatures
to pictures, illustrations, and librettos to operas.</p>

<p>And such are Wagner's productions. And a confirmation
of this is to be seen in the fact that Wagner's
new music lacks the chief characteristic of every true
work of art; namely, such entirety and completeness
that the smallest alteration in its form would disturb the
meaning of the whole work. In a true work of art&mdash;poem,
drama, picture, song, or symphony&mdash;it is impossible
to extract one line, one scene, one figure, or one
bar from its place and put it in another, without infringing
the significance of the whole work; just as it is
impossible, without infringing the life of an organic being,
to extract an organ from one place and insert it
in another. But in the music of Wagner's last period,
with the exception of certain parts of little importance
which have an independent musical meaning, it is possible
to make all kinds of transpositions, putting what
was in front behind, and <i>vice versa</i>, without altering the
musical sense. And the reason why these transpositions
do not alter the sense of Wagner's music is because the
sense lies in the words and not in the music.</p>

<p>The musical score of Wagner's later operas is like what
the result would be should one of those versifiers&mdash;of
whom there are now many, with tongues so broken that
they can write verses on any theme to any rhymes in
any rhythm, which sound as if they had a meaning&mdash;conceive
the idea of illustrating by his verses some symphony
or sonata of Beethoven, or some ballade of
Chopin, in the following manner. To the first bars, of
one character, he writes verses corresponding in his opinion
to those first bars. Next come some bars of a different
character, and he also writes verses corresponding
in his opinion to them, but with no internal connection
with the first verses, and, moreover, without rhymes and
without rhythm. Such a production, without the music,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
would be exactly parallel in poetry to what Wagner's
operas are in music, if heard without the words.</p>

<p>But Wagner is not only a musician, he is also a poet,
or both together; and therefore, to judge of Wagner,
one must know his poetry also&mdash;that same poetry which
the music has to subserve. The chief poetical production
of Wagner is "The Nibelung's Ring." This work
has attained such enormous importance in our time, and
has such influence on all that now professes to be art, that
it is necessary for every one to-day to have some idea of it.
I have carefully read through the four booklets which
contain this work, and have drawn up a brief summary
of it, which I give in Appendix III. I would strongly
advise the reader (if he has not perused the poem itself,
which would be the best thing to do) at least to read my
account of it, so as to have an idea of this extraordinary
work. It is a model work of counterfeit art, so gross
as to be even ridiculous.</p>

<p>But we are told that it is impossible to judge of Wagner's
works without seeing them on the stage. The
Second Day of this drama, which, as I was told, is the
best part of the whole work, was given in Moscow last
winter, and I went to see the performance.</p>

<p>When I arrived the enormous theater was already
filled from top to bottom. There were grand dukes,
and the flower of the aristocracy, of the merchant class,
of the learned, and of the middle-class official public.
Most of them held the libretto, fathoming its meaning.
Musicians&mdash;some of them elderly, gray-haired men&mdash;followed
the music, score in hand. Evidently the performance
of this work was an event of importance.</p>

<p>I was rather late, but I was told that the short prelude,
with which the act begins, was of little importance, and
that it did not matter having missed it. When I arrived,
an actor sat on the stage amid decorations intended to
represent a cave, and before something which was meant
to represent a smith's forge. He was dressed in trico-tights,
with a cloak of skins, wore a wig and an artificial
beard, and with white, weak genteel hands (his easy
movements, and especially the shape of his stomach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
and his lack of muscle revealed the actor) beat an impossible
sword with an unnatural hammer in a way in which
no one ever uses a hammer; and at the same time, opening
his mouth in a strange way, he sang something
incomprehensible. The music of various instruments
accompanied the strange sounds which he emitted.
From the libretto one was able to gather that the actor
had to represent a powerful gnome, who lived in the cave,
and who was forging a sword for Siegfried, whom he
had reared. One could tell he was a gnome by the fact
that the actor walked all the time bending the knees of
his trico-covered legs. This gnome, still opening his
mouth in the same strange way, long continued to sing
or shout. The music meanwhile runs over something
strange, like beginnings which are not continued and do
not get finished. From the libretto one could learn that
the gnome is telling himself about a ring which a giant
had obtained, and which the gnome wishes to procure
through Siegfried's aid, while Siegfried wants a good
sword, on the forging of which the gnome is occupied.
After this conversation or singing to himself has gone
on rather a long time, other sounds are heard in the orchestra,
also like something beginning and not finishing,
and another actor appears, with a horn slung over his
shoulder, and accompanied by a man running on all fours
dressed up as a bear, whom he sets at the smith-gnome.
The latter runs away without unbending the knees of
his trico-covered legs. This actor with the horn represented
the hero, Siegfried. The sounds which were
emitted in the orchestra on the entrance of this actor
were intended to represent Siegfried's character, and
are called Siegfried's <i>leit-motiv</i>. And these sounds are
repeated each time Siegfried appears. There is one
fixed combination of sounds, or <i>leit-motiv</i>, for each character,
and this <i>leit-motiv</i> is repeated every time the person
whom it represents appears; and when any one is
mentioned the <i>motiv</i> is heard which relates to that person.
Moreover, each article also has its own <i>leit-motiv</i>
or chord. There is a <i>motiv</i> of the ring, a <i>motiv</i> of the
helmet, a <i>motiv</i> of the apple, a <i>motiv</i> of fire, spear, sword,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
water, etc.; and as soon as the ring, helmet, or apple is
mentioned, the <i>motiv</i> or chord of the ring, helmet, or
apple is heard. The actor with the horn opens his
mouth as unnaturally as the gnome, and long continues
in a chanting voice to shout some words, and in a similar
chant Mime (that is the gnome's name) answers something
or other to him. The meaning of this conversation
can only be discovered from the libretto; and it is
that Siegfried was brought up by the gnome, and therefore,
for some reason, hates him and always wishes to
kill him. The gnome has forged a sword for Siegfried,
but Siegfried is dissatisfied with it. From a ten-page
conversation (by the libretto), lasting half an hour and
conducted with the same strange openings of the mouth,
and chantings, it appears that Siegfried's mother gave
birth to him in the wood, and that concerning his father
all that is known is that he had a sword which was broken,
the pieces of which are in Mime's possession, and that
Siegfried does not know fear and wishes to go out of
the wood. Mime, however, does not want to let him go.
During the conversation the music never omits, at the
mention of father, sword, etc., to sound the <i>motiv</i> of
these people and things. After these conversations
fresh sounds are heard&mdash;those of the god Wotan&mdash;and
a wanderer appears. This wanderer is the god
Wotan. Also dressed up in a wig, and also in tights,
this god Wotan, standing in a stupid pose with a spear,
thinks proper to recount what Mime must have known
before, but what it is necessary to tell the audience.
He does not tell it simply, but in the form of riddles
which he orders himself to guess, staking his head (one
does not know why) that he will guess right. Moreover,
whenever the wanderer strikes his spear on the ground,
fire comes out of the ground, and in the orchestra the
sounds of spear and of fire are heard. The orchestra
accompanies the conversation, and the <i>motiv</i> of the
people and things spoken of are always artfully intermingled.
Besides this the music expresses feelings in
the most naïve manner: the terrible by sounds in the
bass, the frivolous by rapid touches in the treble, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span></p>

<p>The riddles have no meaning except to tell the audience
what the <i>nibelungs</i> are, what the giants are, what
the gods are, and what has happened before. This
conversation also is chanted with strangely opened
mouths and continues for eight libretto pages, and correspondingly
long on the stage. After this the wanderer
departs, and Siegfried returns and talks with
Mime for thirteen pages more. There is not a single
melody the whole of this time, but merely intertwinings
of the <i>leit-motiv</i> of the people and things mentioned.
The conversation tells that Mime wishes to teach Siegfried
fear, and that Siegfried does not know what fear
is. Having finished this conversation, Siegfried seizes
one of the pieces of what is meant to represent the
broken sword, saws it up, puts it on what is meant to
represent the forge, melts it, and then forges it and sings:
Heiho! heiho! heiho! Ho! ho! Aha! oho! aha!
Heiaho! heiaho! heiaho! Ho! ho! Hahei! hoho!
hahei! and Act I. finishes.</p>

<p>As far as the question I had come to the theater to
decide was concerned, my mind was fully made up, as
surely as on the question of the merits of my lady
acquaintance's novel when she read me the scene between
the loose-haired maiden in the white dress and
the hero with two white dogs and a hat with a feather
<i>à la Guillaume Tell</i>.</p>

<p>From an author who could compose such spurious
scenes, outraging all æsthetic feeling, as those which I
had witnessed, there was nothing to be hoped; it may
safely be decided that all that such an author can write
will be bad, because he evidently does not know what
a true work of art is. I wished to leave, but the friends
I was with asked me to remain, declaring that one could
not form an opinion by that one act, and that the second
would be better. So I stopped for the second act.</p>

<p>Act II., night. Afterward, dawn. In general, the
whole piece is crammed with lights, clouds, moonlight,
darkness, magic fires, thunder, etc.</p>

<p>The scene represents a wood, and in the wood there
is a cave. At the entrance of the cave sits a third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
actor in tights, representing another gnome. It dawns.
Enter the god Wotan, again with a spear, and again in
the guise of a wanderer. Again his sounds, together
with fresh sounds of the deepest bass that can be produced.
These latter indicate that the dragon is speaking.
Wotan awakens the dragon. The same bass
sounds are repeated, growing yet deeper and deeper.
First the dragon says, "I want to sleep," but afterward
he crawls out of the cave. The dragon is represented
by two men; it is dressed in a green, scaly skin, waves
a tail at one end, while at the other it opens a kind of
crocodile's jaw that is fastened on, and from which
flames appear. The dragon (who is meant to be dreadful,
and may appear so to five-year-old children) speaks
some words in a terribly bass voice. This is all so
stupid, so like what is done in a booth at a fair, that it
is surprising that people over seven years of age can
witness it seriously; yet thousands of quasi-cultured
people sit and attentively hear and see it, and are
delighted.</p>

<p>Siegfried, with his horn, reappears, as does Mime also.
In the orchestra the sounds denoting them are emitted,
and they talk about whether Siegfried does or does not
know what fear is. Mime goes away, and a scene commences
which is intended to be most poetical. Siegfried,
in his tights, lies down in a would-be beautiful pose, and
alternately keeps silent and talks to himself. He ponders,
listens to the song of birds, and wishes to imitate
them. For this purpose he cuts a reed with his sword
and makes a pipe. The dawn grows brighter and
brighter; the birds sing. Siegfried tries to imitate the
birds. In the orchestra is heard the imitation of birds,
alternating with sounds corresponding to the words he
speaks. But Siegfried does not succeed with his pipe-playing,
so he plays on his horn instead. This scene
is unendurable. Of music, <i>i.e.</i> of art serving as a means
to transmit a state of mind experienced by the author,
there is not even a suggestion. There is something that
is absolutely unintelligible musically. In a musical sense
a hope is continually experienced, followed by disappointment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
as if a musical thought were commenced
only to be broken off. If there are something like
musical commencements, these commencements are so
short, so encumbered with complications of harmony
and orchestration and with effects of contrast, are so
obscure and unfinished, and what is happening on the
stage meanwhile is so abominably false, that it is difficult
even to perceive these musical snatches, let alone
to be infected by them. Above all, from the very beginning
to the very end, and in each note, the author's
purpose is so audible and visible that one sees and
hears neither Siegfried nor the birds, but only a limited,
self-opinionated German, of bad taste and bad style,
who has a most false conception of poetry, and who, in
the rudest and most primitive manner, wishes to transmit
to me these false and mistaken conceptions of his.</p>

<p>Every one knows the feeling of distrust and resistance
which is always evoked by an author's evident predetermination.
A narrator need only say in advance, Prepare
to cry or to laugh, and you are sure neither to cry nor to
laugh. But when you see that an author prescribes emotion
at what is not touching, but only laughable or disgusting,
and when you see, moreover, that the author is
fully assured that he has captivated you, a painfully
tormenting feeling results, similar to what one would
feel if an old, deformed woman put on a ball-dress, and
smilingly coquetted before you, confident of your approbation.
This impression was strengthened by the fact
that around me I saw a crowd of three thousand people,
who not only patiently witnessed all this absurd nonsense,
but even considered it their duty to be delighted
with it.</p>

<p>I somehow managed to sit out the next scene also, in
which the monster appears, to the accompaniment of
his bass notes intermingled with the <i>motiv</i> of Siegfried;
but after the fight with the monster, and all the roars,
fires, and sword-wavings, I could stand no more of it,
and escaped from the theater with a feeling of repulsion
which, even now, I cannot forget.</p>

<p>Listening to this opera, I involuntarily thought of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
respected, wise, educated country laborer,&mdash;one, for
instance, of those wise and truly religious men whom I
know among the peasants,&mdash;and I pictured to myself
the terrible perplexity such a man would be in were he
to witness what I was seeing that evening.</p>

<p>What would he think if he knew of all the labor spent
on such a performance, and saw that audience, those
great ones of the earth,&mdash;old, bald-headed, gray-bearded
men, whom he had been accustomed to respect,&mdash;sit
silent and attentive, listening to and looking at all these
stupidities for five hours on end? Not to speak of an
adult laborer, one can hardly imagine even a child of
over seven occupying himself with such a stupid, incoherent
fairy tale.</p>

<p>And yet an enormous audience, the cream of the cultured
upper classes, sits out five hours of this insane
performance, and goes away imagining that by paying
tribute to this nonsense it has acquired a fresh right to
esteem itself advanced and enlightened.</p>

<p>I speak of the Moscow public. But what is the Moscow
public? It is but a hundredth part of that public
which, while considering itself most highly enlightened,
esteems it a merit to have so lost the capacity of being
infected by art, that not only can it witness this stupid
sham without being revolted, but can even take delight
in it.</p>

<p>In Bayreuth, where these performances were first
given, people who consider themselves finely cultured
assembled from the ends of the earth, spent, say one
hundred pounds each, to see this performance, and for
four days running they went to see and hear this nonsensical
rubbish, sitting it out for six hours each day.</p>

<p>But why did people go, and why do they still go to
these performances, and why do they admire them?
The question naturally presents itself: How is the success
of Wagner's works to be explained?</p>

<p>That success I explain to myself in this way: thanks
to his exceptional position in having at his disposal the
resources of a king, Wagner was able to command all
the methods for counterfeiting art which have been developed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
by long usage, and, employing these methods
with great ability, he produced a model work of counterfeit
art. The reason why I have selected his work
for my illustration is, that in no other counterfeit of art
known to me are all the methods by which art is counterfeited&mdash;namely,
borrowings, imitation, effects, and
interestingness&mdash;so ably and powerfully united.</p>

<p>From the subject, borrowed from antiquity, to the
clouds and the risings of the sun and moon, Wagner, in
this work, has made use of all that is considered poetical.
We have here the sleeping beauty, and nymphs,
and subterranean fires, and gnomes, and battles, and
swords, and love, and incest, and a monster, and singing-birds&mdash;the
whole arsenal of the poetical is brought into
action.</p>

<p>Moreover, everything is imitative; the decorations
are imitated, and the costumes are imitated. All are just
as, according to the data supplied by archæology, they
would have been in antiquity. The very sounds are imitative;
for Wagner, who was not destitute of musical
talent, invented just such sounds as imitate the strokes
of a hammer, the hissing of molten iron, the singing of
birds, etc.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in this work everything is in the highest
degree striking in its effects and in its peculiarities:
its monsters, its magic fires, and its scenes under water;
the darkness in which the audience sit, the invisibility
of the orchestra, and the hitherto unemployed combinations
of harmony.</p>

<p>And besides, it is all interesting. The interest lies
not only in the question who will kill whom, and who
will marry whom, and who is whose son, and what will
happen next?&mdash;the interest lies also in the relation of
the music to the text. The rolling waves of the Rhine&mdash;now
how is that to be expressed in music? An evil
gnome appears&mdash;how is the music to express an evil
gnome?&mdash;and how is it to express the sensuality of
this gnome? How will bravery, fire, or apples be expressed
in music? How are the <i>leit-motiv</i> of the people
speaking to be interwoven with the <i>leit-motiv</i> of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
people and objects about whom they speak? Besides,
the music has a further interest. It diverges from all
formerly accepted laws, and most unexpected and totally
new modulations crop up (as is not only possible, but
even easy in music having no inner law of its being);
the dissonances are new, and are allowed in a new way&mdash;and
this, too, is interesting.</p>

<p>And it is this poeticality, imitativeness, effectfulness,
and interestingness which, thanks to the peculiarities of
Wagner's talent, and to the advantageous position in
which he was placed, are in these productions carried
to the highest pitch of perfection, that so act on the
spectator, hypnotizing him as one would be hypnotized
who should listen for several consecutive hours to the
ravings of a maniac pronounced with great oratorical
power.</p>

<p>People say: "You cannot judge without having seen
Wagner performed at Bayreuth: in the dark, where the
orchestra is out of sight concealed under the stage, and
where the performance is brought to the highest perfection."
And this just proves that we have here no
question of art, but one of hypnotism. It is just what
the spiritualists say. To convince you of the reality of
their apparitions they usually say, "You cannot judge;
you must try it, be present at several séances," <i>i.e.</i> come
and sit silent in the dark for hours together in the same
room with semi-sane people, and repeat this some ten
times over, and you shall see all that we see.</p>

<p>Yes, naturally! Only place yourself in such conditions,
and you may see what you will. But this can be
still more quickly attained by getting drunk or smoking
opium. It is the same when listening to an opera of
Wagner's. Sit in the dark for four days in company
with people who are not quite normal, and, through the
auditory nerves, subject your brain to the strongest action
of the sounds best adapted to excite it, and you
will no doubt be reduced to an abnormal condition, and
be enchanted by absurdities. But to attain this end you
do not even need four days; the five hours during which
one "day" is enacted, as in Moscow, are quite enough.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
Nor are five hours needed; even one hour is enough
for people who have no clear conception of what art
should be, and who have come to the conclusion in advance
that what they are going to see is excellent, and
that indifference or dissatisfaction with this work will
serve as a proof of their inferiority and lack of culture.</p>

<p>I observed the audience present at this representation.
The people who led the whole audience and gave
the tone to it were those who had previously been hypnotized,
and who again succumbed to the hypnotic influence
to which they were accustomed. These hypnotized
people, being in an abnormal condition, were perfectly
enraptured. Moreover, all the art critics, who lack the
capacity to be infected by art and therefore always
especially prize works like Wagner's opera where it is
all an affair of the intellect, also, with much profundity,
expressed their approval of a work affording such ample
material for ratiocination. And following these two
groups went that large city crowd (indifferent to art, with
their capacity to be infected by it perverted and partly
atrophied), headed by the princes, millionaires, and
art patrons, who, like sorry harriers, keep close to those
who most loudly and decidedly express their opinion.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, certainly! What poetry! Marvelous! Especially
the birds!" "Yes, yes! I am quite vanquished!"
exclaim these people, repeating in various tones what they
have just heard from men whose opinion appears to
them authoritative.</p>

<p>If some people do feel insulted by the absurdity and
spuriousness of the whole thing, they are timidly silent,
as sober men are timid and silent when surrounded by
tipsy ones.</p>

<p>And thus, thanks to the masterly skill with which it
counterfeits art while having nothing in common with it, a
meaningless, coarse, spurious production finds acceptance
all over the world, costs millions of roubles to produce,
and assists more and more to pervert the taste of people
of the upper classes and their conception of what is art.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>


<p>I know that most men&mdash;not only those considered
clever, but even those who are very clever, and capable
of understanding most difficult scientific, mathematical,
or philosophic problems&mdash;can very seldom discern even
the simplest and most obvious truth if it be such as to
oblige them to admit the falsity of conclusions they have
formed, perhaps with much difficulty&mdash;conclusions of
which they are proud, which they have taught to others,
and on which they have built their lives. And therefore
I have little hope that what I adduce as to the perversion
of art and taste in our society will be accepted or even
seriously considered. Nevertheless, I must state fully
the inevitable conclusion to which my investigation into
the question of art has brought me. This investigation
has brought me to the conviction that almost all that
our society considers to be art, good art, and the whole
of art, far from being real and good art, and the whole
of art, is not even art at all, but only a counterfeit of it.
This position, I know, will seem very strange and paradoxical;
but if we once acknowledge art to be a human
activity by means of which some people transmit their
feelings to others (and not a service of Beauty, nor a
manifestation of the Idea, and so forth), we shall inevitably
have to admit this further conclusion also. If it
is true that art is an activity by means of which one
man, having experienced a feeling, intentionally transmits
it to others, then we have inevitably to admit further,
that of all that among us is termed the art of the upper
classes&mdash;of all those novels, stories, dramas, comedies,
pictures, sculptures, symphonies, operas, operettas, ballets,
etc., which profess to be works of art&mdash;scarcely
one in a hundred thousand proceeds from an emotion
felt by its author, all the rest being but manufactured
counterfeits of art, in which borrowing, imitating, effects,
and interestingness replace the contagion of feeling.
That the proportion of real productions of art is to the
counterfeits as one to some hundreds of thousands or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
even more, may be seen by the following calculation.
I have read somewhere that the artist painters in Paris
alone number 30,000; there will probably be as many
in England, as many in Germany, and as many in Russia,
Italy, and the smaller states combined. So that in all
there will be in Europe, say, 120,000 painters; and there
are probably as many musicians and as many literary
artists. If these 360,000 individuals produce three works
a year each (and many of them produce ten or more),
then each year yields over a million so-called works of
art. How many, then, must have been produced in the
last ten years, and how many in the whole time since
upper-class art broke off from the art of the whole
people? Evidently millions. Yet who of all the connoisseurs
of art has received impressions from all these
pseudo works of art? Not to mention all the laboring
classes who have no conception of these productions,
even people of the upper classes cannot know one in a
thousand of them all, and cannot remember those they
have known. These works all appear under the guise of
art, produce no impression on any one (except when they
serve as pastimes for the idle crowd of rich people), and
vanish utterly.</p>

<p>In reply to this it is usually said that without this
enormous number of unsuccessful attempts we should
not have the real works of art. But such reasoning is
as though a baker, in reply to a reproach that his bread
was bad, were to say that if it were not for the hundreds
of spoiled loaves there would not be any well-baked ones.
It is true that where there is gold there is also much
sand; but that cannot serve as a reason for talking a
lot of nonsense in order to say something wise.</p>

<p>We are surrounded by productions considered artistic.
Thousands of verses, thousands of poems, thousands
of novels, thousands of dramas, thousands of pictures,
thousands of musical pieces, follow one after another.
All the verses describe love, or nature, or the author's
state of mind, and in all of them rhyme and rhythm
are observed. All the dramas and comedies are splendidly
mounted and are performed by admirably trained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
actors. All the novels are divided into chapters; all
of them describe love, contain effective situations, and
correctly describe the details of life. All the symphonies
contain <i>allegro</i>, <i>andante</i>, <i>scherzo</i>, and <i>finale</i>; all consist
of modulations and chords, and are played by highly
trained musicians. All the pictures, in gold frames,
saliently depict faces and sundry accessories. But
among these productions in the various branches of art,
there is in each branch one among hundreds of thousands,
not only somewhat better than the rest, but
differing from them as a diamond differs from paste.
The one is priceless, the others not only have no value,
but are worse than valueless, for they deceive and pervert
taste. And yet, externally, they are, to a man
of perverted or atrophied artistic perception, precisely
alike.</p>

<p>In our society the difficulty of recognizing real works
of art is further increased by the fact that the external
quality of the work in false productions is not only no
worse, but often better, than in real ones; the counterfeit
is often more effective than the real, and its subject
more interesting. How is one to discriminate? How
is one to find a production in no way distinguished in
externals from hundreds of thousands of others intentionally
made to imitate it precisely?</p>

<p>For a country peasant of unperverted taste this is as
easy as it is for an animal of unspoilt scent to follow
the trace he needs among a thousand others in wood
or forest. The animal unerringly finds what he needs.
So also the man, if only his natural qualities have not
been perverted, will, without fail, select from among
thousands of objects the real work of art he requires,&mdash;that
infecting him with the feeling experienced by the
artist. But it is not so with those whose taste has been
perverted by their education and life. The receptive
feeling for art of these people is atrophied, and in valuing
artistic productions they must be guided by discussion
and study, which discussion and study completely
confuse them. So that most people in our society are
quite unable to distinguish a work of art from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
grossest counterfeit. People sit for whole hours in
concert-rooms and theaters listening to the new composers,
consider it a duty to read the novels of the
famous modern novelists, and to look at pictures representing
either something incomprehensible, or just the
very things they see much better in real life; and, above
all, they consider it incumbent on them to be enraptured
by all this, imagining it all to be art, while at the same
time they will pass real works of art by, not only without
attention, but even with contempt, merely because,
in their circle, these works are not included in the list of
works of art.</p>

<p>A few days ago I was returning home from a walk
feeling depressed, as occurs sometimes. On nearing
the house I heard the loud singing of a large choir
of peasant women. They were welcoming my daughter,
celebrating her return home after her marriage. In this
singing, with its cries and clanging of scythes, such a
definite feeling of joy, cheerfulness, and energy was
expressed, that, without noticing how it infected me,
I continued my way toward the house in a better mood,
and reached home smiling, and quite in good spirits.
That same evening, a visitor, an admirable musician,
famed for his execution of classical music, and particularly
of Beethoven, played us Beethoven's sonata, Opus
101. For the benefit of those who might otherwise
attribute my judgment of that sonata of Beethoven
to non-comprehension of it, I should mention that, whatever
other people understand of that sonata and of
other productions of Beethoven's later period, I, being
very susceptible to music, equally understood. For
a long time I used to attune myself so as to delight
in those shapeless improvisations which form the subject-matter
of the works of Beethoven's later period, but I
had only to consider the question of art seriously, and
to compare the impression I received from Beethoven's
later works with those pleasant, clear, and strong musical
impressions which are transmitted, for instance, by
the melodies of Bach (his arias), Haydn, Mozart, Chopin,
(when his melodies are not overloaded with complications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
and ornamentation), and of Beethoven himself in
his earlier period, and, above all, with the impressions
produced by folk-songs,&mdash;Italian, Norwegian, or Russian,&mdash;by
the Hungarian <i>tzardas</i>, and other such simple,
clear, and powerful music, and the obscure, almost
unhealthy excitement from Beethoven's later pieces that
I had artificially evoked in myself was immediately
destroyed.</p>

<p>On the completion of the performance (though it was
noticeable that every one had become dull) those present,
in the accepted manner, warmly praised Beethoven's
profound production, and did not forget to add that
formerly they had not been able to understand that last
period of his, but that they now saw that he was really
then at his very best. And when I ventured to compare
the impression made on me by the singing of the
peasant women&mdash;an impression which had been shared
by all who heard it&mdash;with the effect of this sonata,
the admirers of Beethoven only smiled contemptuously,
not considering it necessary to reply to such strange
remarks.</p>

<p>But, for all that, the song of the peasant women was
real art, transmitting a definite and strong feeling; while
the 101st sonata of Beethoven was only an unsuccessful
attempt at art, containing no definite feeling, and therefore
not infectious.</p>

<p>For my work on art I have this winter read diligently,
though with great effort, the celebrated novels and
stories, praised by all Europe, written by Zola, Bourget,
Huysmans, and Kipling. At the same time I chanced
on a story in a child's magazine, and by a quite unknown
writer, which told of the Easter preparations in a poor
widow's family. The story tells how the mother managed
with difficulty to obtain some wheat-flour, which
she poured on the table ready to knead. She then went
out to procure some yeast, telling the children not to
leave the hut, and to take care of the flour. When the
mother had gone, some other children ran shouting near
the window, calling those in the hut to come to play. The
children forgot their mother's warning, ran into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
street, and were soon engrossed in the game. The
mother, on her return with the yeast, finds a hen on the
table throwing the last of the flour to her chickens, who
were busily picking it out of the dust of the earthen
floor. The mother, in despair, scolds the children, who
cry bitterly. And the mother begins to feel pity for
them&mdash;but the white flour has all gone. So to mend
matters she decides to make the Easter cake with sifted
rye-flour, brushing it over with white of egg, and surrounding
it with eggs. "Rye-bread which we bake is
akin to any cake," says the mother, using a rhyming
proverb to console the children for not having an
Easter cake made with white flour. And the children,
quickly passing from despair to rapture, repeat the proverb
and await the Easter cake more merrily even than
before.</p>

<p>Well! the reading of the novels and stories by Zola,
Bourget, Huysmans, Kipling, and others, handling the
most harrowing subjects, did not touch me for one
moment, and I was provoked with the authors all the
while, as one is provoked with a man who considers you
so naïve that he does not even conceal the trick by
which he intends to take you in. From the first lines
you see the intention with which the book is written,
and the details all become superfluous, and one feels
dull. Above all, one knows that the author had no
other feeling all the time than a desire to write a story
or a novel, and so one receives no artistic impression.
On the other hand, I could not tear myself away from
the unknown author's tale of the children and the
chickens, because I was at once infected by the feeling
which the author had evidently experienced, reëvoked in
himself, and transmitted.</p>

<p>Vasnetsoff is one of our Russian painters. He has
painted ecclesiastical pictures in Kieff Cathedral, and
every one praises him as the founder of some new, elevated
kind of Christian art. He worked at those
pictures for ten years, was paid tens of thousands
of roubles for them, and they are all simply bad imitations
of imitations of imitations, destitute of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
spark of feeling. And this same Vasnetsoff drew a
picture for Tourgenieff's story, "The Quail" (in which
it is told how, in his son's presence, a father killed
a quail and felt pity for it), showing the boy asleep
with pouting upper lip, and above him, as a dream,
the quail. And this picture is a true work of art.</p>

<p>In the English Academy of 1897 two pictures were
exhibited together; one of which, by J. C. Dolman,
was the temptation of St. Anthony. The saint is on
his knees praying. Behind him stands a naked woman
and animals of some kind. It is apparent that the
naked woman pleased the artist very much, but that
Anthony did not concern him at all; and that, so far
from the temptation being terrible to him (the artist)
it is highly agreeable. And therefore if there be any
art in this picture, it is very nasty and false. Next in
the same book of academy pictures comes a picture by
Langley, showing a stray beggar-boy, who has evidently
been called in by a woman who has taken pity
on him. The boy, pitifully drawing his bare feet
under the bench, is eating; the woman is looking on,
probably considering whether he will not want some
more; and a girl of about seven, leaning on her arm,
is carefully and seriously looking on, not taking her
eyes from the hungry boy, and evidently understanding
for the first time what poverty is, and what inequality
among people is, and asking herself why she
has everything provided for her while this boy goes
barefoot and hungry? She feels sorry, and yet pleased.
And she loves both the boy and goodness.... And one
feels that the artist loved this girl, and that she too loves.
And this picture, by an artist who, I think, is not very
widely known, is an admirable and true work of art.</p>

<p>I remember seeing a performance of "Hamlet" by
Rossi. Both the tragedy itself and the performer who
took the chief part are considered by our critics to
represent the climax of supreme dramatic art. And
yet, both from the subject-matter of the drama and
from the performance, I experienced all the time that
peculiar suffering which is caused by false imitations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
of works of art. And I lately read of a theatrical
performance among the savage tribe, the Voguls. A
spectator describes the play. A big Vogul and a little
one, both dressed in reindeer skins, represent a reindeer-doe
and its young. A third Vogul, with a bow,
represents a huntsman on snow-shoes, and a fourth
imitates with his voice a bird that warns the reindeer
of their danger. The play is that the huntsman follows
the track that the doe with its young one has
traveled. The deer run off the scene, and again reappear.
(Such performances take place in a small
tent-house.) The huntsman gains more and more on
the pursued. The little deer is tired, and presses
against its mother. The doe stops to draw breath.
The hunter comes up with them and draws his bow.
But just then the bird sounds its note, warning the
deer of their danger. They escape. Again there is
a chase, and again the hunter gains on them, catches
them, and lets fly his arrow. The arrow strikes the
young deer. Unable to run, the little one presses
against its mother. The mother licks its wound. The
hunter draws another arrow. The audience, as the
eye-witness describes them, are paralyzed with suspense;
deep groans and even weeping is heard among
them. And, from the mere description, I felt that
this was a true work of art.</p>

<p>What I am saying will be considered irrational paradox,
at which one can only be amazed; but for all that
I must say what I think; namely, that people of our circle,
of whom some compose verses, stories, novels, operas,
symphonies, and sonatas, paint all kinds of pictures and
make statues, while others hear and look at these things,
and again others appraise and criticize it all, discuss, condemn,
triumph, and raise monuments to one another,
generation after generation,&mdash;that all these people, with
very few exceptions, artists, and public, and critics, have
never (except in childhood and earliest youth, before
hearing any discussions on art) experienced that simple
feeling familiar to the plainest man and even to a child,
that sense of infection with another's feeling,&mdash;compelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
us to joy in another's gladness, to sorrow at another's
grief, and to mingle souls with another,&mdash;which
is the very essence of art. And therefore these people
not only cannot distinguish true works of art from counterfeits,
but continually mistake for real art the worst
and most artificial, while they do not even perceive works
of real art, because the counterfeits are always more
ornate, while true art is modest.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>


<p>Art, in our society, has been so perverted that not
only has bad art come to be considered good, but even
the very perception of what art really is has been lost. In
order to be able to speak about the art of our society, it
is, therefore, first of all necessary to distinguish art from
counterfeit art.</p>

<p>There is one indubitable indication distinguishing real
art from its counterfeit, namely, the infectiousness of
art. If a man, without exercising effort and without
altering his standpoint, on reading, hearing, or seeing
another man's work, experiences a mental condition
which unites him with that man and with other people
who also partake of that work of art, then the object
evoking that condition is a work of art. And however
poetical, realistic, effectful, or interesting a work may be,
it is not a work of art if it does not evoke that feeling
(quite distinct from all other feelings) of joy, and of
spiritual union with another (the author) and with others
(those who are also infected by it).</p>

<p>It is true that this indication is an <i>internal</i> one, and
that there are people who have forgotten what the action
of real art is, who expect something else from art (in our
society the great majority are in this state), and that
therefore such people may mistake for this æsthetic feeling
the feeling of divertisement and a certain excitement
which they receive from counterfeits of art. But though
it is impossible to undeceive these people, just as it is
impossible to convince a man suffering from "Daltonism"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
that green is not red, yet, for all that, this indication
remains perfectly definite to those whose feeling for
art is neither perverted nor atrophied, and it clearly distinguishes
the feeling produced by art from all other
feelings.</p>

<p>The chief peculiarity of this feeling is that the receiver
of a true artistic impression is so united to the artist that
he feels as if the work were his own and not some one
else's,&mdash;as if what it expresses were just what he had
long been wishing to express. A real work of art destroys,
in the consciousness of the receiver, the separation
between himself and the artist; nor that alone, but
also between himself and all whose minds receive this
work of art. In this freeing of our personality from its
separation and isolation, in this uniting of it with others,
lies the chief characteristic and the great attractive force
of art.</p>

<p>If a man is infected by the author's condition of soul,
if he feels this emotion and this union with others, then
the object which has effected this is art; but if there be
no such infection, if there be not this union with the author
and with others who are moved by the same work&mdash;then
it is not art. And not only is infection a sure
sign of art, but the degree of infectiousness is also the
sole measure of excellence in art.</p>

<p><i>The stronger the infection the better is the art; as art</i>,
speaking now apart from its subject-matter, <i>i.e.</i> not
considering the quality of the feelings it transmits.</p>

<p>And the degree of the infectiousness of art depends
on three conditions:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) On the greater or lesser individuality of the feeling
transmitted; (2) on the greater or lesser clearness
with which the feeling is transmitted; (3) on the sincerity
of the artist, <i>i.e.</i> on the greater or lesser force with
which the artist himself feels the emotion he transmits.</p>

<p>The more individual the feeling transmitted the more
strongly does it act on the receiver; the more individual
the state of soul into which he is transferred the more
pleasure does the receiver obtain, and therefore the more
readily and strongly does he join in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span></p>

<p>The clearness of expression assists infection, because
the receiver, who mingles in consciousness with the author,
is the better satisfied the more clearly the feeling
is transmitted, which, as it seems to him, he has long
known and felt, and for which he has only now found
expression.</p>

<p>But most of all is the degree of infectiousness of art
increased by the degree of sincerity in the artist. As
soon as the spectator, hearer, or reader feels that the
artist is infected by his own production, and writes, sings,
or plays for himself, and not merely to act on others, this
mental condition of the artist infects the receiver; and,
contrariwise, as soon as the spectator, reader, or hearer
feels that the author is not writing, singing, or playing
for his own satisfaction,&mdash;does not himself feel what
he wishes to express,&mdash;but is doing it for him, the receiver,
a resistance immediately springs up, and the most
individual and the newest feelings and the cleverest technique
not only fail to produce any infection, but actually
repel.</p>

<p>I have mentioned three conditions of contagiousness
in art, but they may be all summed up into one, the last,
sincerity, <i>i.e.</i> that the artist should be impelled by an inner
need to express his feeling. That condition includes
the first; for if the artist is sincere he will express the
feeling as he experienced it. And as each man is different
from every one else, his feeling will be individual
for every one else; and the more individual it is,&mdash;the
more the artist has drawn it from the depths of his nature,&mdash;the
more sympathetic and sincere will it be.
And this same sincerity will impel the artist to find
a clear expression of the feeling which he wishes to
transmit.</p>

<p>Therefore this third condition&mdash;sincerity&mdash;is the
most important of the three. It is always complied with
in peasant art, and this explains why such art always
acts so powerfully; but it is a condition almost entirely
absent from our upper-class art, which is continually
produced by artists actuated by personal aims of covetousness
or vanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span></p>

<p>Such are the three conditions which divide art from
its counterfeits, and which also decide the quality of
every work of art apart from its subject-matter.</p>

<p>The absence of any one of these conditions excludes
a work from the category of art and relegates it to that
of art's counterfeits. If the work does not transmit the
artist's peculiarity of feeling, and is therefore not individual,
if it is unintelligibly expressed, or if it has not
proceeded from the author's inner need for expression&mdash;it
is not a work of art. If all these conditions are
present, even in the smallest degree, then the work,
even if a weak one, is yet a work of art.</p>

<p>The presence in various degrees of these three conditions&mdash;individuality,
clearness, and sincerity&mdash;decides
the merit of a work of art, as art, apart from subject-matter.
All works of art take rank of merit according
to the degree in which they fulfil the first, the second,
and the third of these conditions. In one the individuality
of the feeling transmitted may predominate; in
another, clearness of expression; in a third, sincerity;
while a fourth may have sincerity and individuality, but
be deficient in clearness; a fifth, individuality and clearness,
but less sincerity; and so forth, in all possible
degrees and combinations.</p>

<p>Thus is art divided from not art, and thus is the quality
of art, as art, decided, independently of its subject-matter,
<i>i.e.</i> apart from whether the feelings it transmits
are good or bad.</p>

<p>But how are we to define good and bad art with reference
to its subject-matter?</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>


<p>How in art are we to decide what is good and what
is bad in subject-matter?</p>

<p>Art, like speech, is a means of communication, and
therefore of progress, <i>i.e.</i> of the movement of humanity
forward toward perfection. Speech renders accessible
to men of the latest generations all the knowledge discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
by the experience and reflection, both of preceding
generations and of the best and foremost men
of their own times; art renders accessible to men of
the latest generations all the feelings experienced by
their predecessors, and those also which are being felt
by their best and foremost contemporaries. And as
the evolution of knowledge proceeds by truer and more
necessary knowledge dislodging and replacing what is
mistaken and unnecessary, so the evolution of feeling
proceeds through art,&mdash;feelings less kind and less needful
for the well-being of mankind are replaced by others
kinder and more needful for that end. That is the purpose
of art. And, speaking now of its subject-matter,
the more art fulfils that purpose the better the art, and
the less it fulfils it the worse the art.</p>

<p>And the appraisement of feelings (<i>i.e.</i> the acknowledgment
of these or those feelings as being more or less
good, more or less necessary for the well-being of mankind)
is made by the religious perception of the age.</p>

<p>In every period of history, and in every human society,
there exists an understanding of the meaning of
life which represents the highest level to which men of
that society have attained,&mdash;an understanding defining
the highest good at which that society aims. And this
understanding is the religious perception of the given
time and society. And this religious perception is
always clearly expressed by some advanced men, and
more or less vividly perceived by all the members of
the society. Such a religious perception and its corresponding
expression exists always in every society.
If it appears to us that in our society there is no religious
perception, this is not because there really is none,
but only because we do not want to see it. And we
often wish not to see it because it exposes the fact that
our life is inconsistent with that religious perception.</p>

<p>Religious perception in a society is like the direction
of a flowing river. If the river flows at all, it must have
a direction. If a society lives, there must be a religious
perception indicating the direction in which, more or
less consciously, all its members tend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span></p>

<p>And so there always has been, and there is, a religious
perception in every society. And it is by the standard
of this religious perception that the feelings transmitted
by art have always been estimated. Only on the basis
of this religious perception of their age have men always
chosen from the endlessly varied spheres of art that art
which transmitted feelings making religious perception
operative in actual life. And such art has always been
highly valued and encouraged; while art transmitting
feelings already outlived, flowing from the antiquated
religious perceptions of a former age, has always been
condemned and despised. All the rest of art, transmitting
those most diverse feelings by means of which
people commune together, was not condemned, and was
tolerated, if only it did not transmit feelings contrary to
religious perception. Thus, for instance, among the
Greeks, art transmitting the feeling of beauty, strength,
and courage (Hesiod, Homer, Phidias) was chosen, approved,
and encouraged; while art transmitting feelings
of rude sensuality, despondency, and effeminacy was
condemned and despised. Among the Jews, art transmitting
feelings of devotion and submission to the God
of the Hebrews and to His will (the epic of Genesis, the
prophets, the Psalms) was chosen and encouraged, while
art transmitting feelings of idolatry (the golden calf) was
condemned and despised. All the rest of art&mdash;stories,
songs, dances, ornamentation of houses, of utensils, and
of clothes&mdash;which was not contrary to religious perception,
was neither distinguished nor discussed. Thus,
in regard to its subject-matter, has art been appraised
always and everywhere, and thus it should be appraised;
for this attitude toward art proceeds from the fundamental
characteristics of human nature, and those characteristics
do not change.</p>

<p>I know that according to an opinion current in our
times religion is a superstition which humanity has outgrown,
and that it is therefore assumed that no such
thing exists as a religious perception, common to us all,
by which art, in our time, can be estimated. I know
that this is the opinion current in the pseudo-cultured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
circles of to-day. People who do not acknowledge
Christianity in its true meaning because it undermines
all their social privileges, and who, therefore, invent all
kinds of philosophic and æsthetic theories to hide from
themselves the meaninglessness and wrongness of their
lives, cannot think otherwise. These people intentionally,
or sometimes unintentionally, confusing the conception
of a religious cult with the conception of religious
perception, think that by denying the cult they get rid
of religious perception. But even the very attacks on
religion, and the attempts to establish a life-conception
contrary to the religious perception of our times, most
clearly demonstrate the existence of a religious perception
condemning the lives that are not in harmony
with it.</p>

<p>If humanity progresses, <i>i.e.</i> moves forward, there
must inevitably be a guide to the direction of that movement.
And religions have always furnished that guide.
All history shows that the progress of humanity is accomplished
not otherwise than under the guidance of
religion. But if the race cannot progress without the
guidance of religion,&mdash;and progress is always going on,
and consequently also in our own times,&mdash;then there
must be a religion of our times. So that, whether it
pleases or displeases the so-called cultured people of to-day,
they must admit the existence of religion,&mdash;not of
a religious cult, Catholic, Protestant, or another, but of
religious perception,&mdash;which, even in our times, is the
guide always present where there is any progress. And
if a religious perception exists amongst us, then our art
should be appraised on the basis of that religious perception;
and, as has always and everywhere been the
case, art transmitting feelings flowing from the religious
perception of our time should be chosen from all the
indifferent art, should be acknowledged, highly esteemed,
and encouraged; while art running counter to that perception
should be condemned and despised, and all the
remaining indifferent art should neither be distinguished
nor encouraged.</p>

<p>The religious perception of our time, in its widest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
and most practical application, is the consciousness
that our well-being, both material and spiritual, individual
and collective, temporal and eternal, lies in the
growth of brotherhood among all men&mdash;in their loving
harmony with one another. This perception is not
only expressed by Christ and all the best men of past
ages, it is not only repeated in the most varied forms
and from most diverse sides by the best men of our
own times, but it already serves as a clue to all the
complex labor of humanity, consisting as this labor
does, on the one hand, in the destruction of physical
and moral obstacles to the union of men, and, on the
other hand, in establishing the principles common to
all men which can and should unite them into one universal
brotherhood. And it is on the basis of this
perception that we should appraise all the phenomena
of our life, and, among the rest, our art also; choosing
from all its realms whatever transmits feelings flowing
from this religious perception, highly prizing and encouraging
such art, rejecting whatever is contrary to
this perception, and not attributing to the rest of art
an importance not properly pertaining to it.</p>

<p>The chief mistake made by people of the upper
classes of the time of the so-called Renaissance&mdash;a
mistake which we still perpetuate&mdash;was not that they
ceased to value and to attach importance to religious
art (people of that period could not attach importance
to it, because, like our own upper classes, they could
not believe in what the majority considered to be religion),
but their mistake was that they set up in place
of religious art, which was lacking, an insignificant art
which aimed only at giving pleasure, <i>i.e.</i> they began
to choose, to value, and to encourage, in place of
religious art, something which, in any case, did not
deserve such esteem and encouragement.</p>

<p>One of the Fathers of the Church said that the great
evil is, not that men do not know God, but that they
have set up, instead of God, that which is not God. So
also with art. The great misfortune of the people of
the upper classes of our time is not so much that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
are without a religious art, as that, instead of a supreme
religious art, chosen from all the rest as being specially
important and valuable, they have chosen a most insignificant
and, usually, harmful art, which aims at
pleasing certain people, and which, therefore, if only
by its exclusive nature, stands in contradiction to that
Christian principle of universal union which forms the
religious perception of our time. Instead of religious
art, an empty and often vicious art is set up, and this
hides from men's notice the need of that true religious
art which should be present in life in order to improve
it.</p>

<p>It is true that art which satisfies the demands of the
religious perception of our time is quite unlike former
art, but, notwithstanding this dissimilarity, to a man who
does not intentionally hide the truth from himself, it is
very clear and definite what does form the religious art
of our age. In former times, when the highest religious
perception united only some people (who, even if they
formed a large society, were yet but one society surrounded
by others&mdash;Jews, or Athenian or Roman citizens),
the feelings transmitted by the art of that time
flowed from a desire for the might, greatness, glory, and
prosperity of that society, and the heroes of art might be
people who contributed to that prosperity by strength,
by craft, by fraud, or by cruelty (Ulysses, Jacob, David,
Samson, Hercules, and all the heroes). But the religious
perception of our times does not select any one society
of men; on the contrary, it demands the union of all,&mdash;absolutely
of all people without exception,&mdash;and above
every other virtue it sets brotherly love to all men. And,
therefore, the feelings transmitted by the art of our time
not only cannot coincide with the feelings transmitted
by former art, but must run counter to them.</p>

<p>Christian, truly Christian, art has been so long in establishing
itself, and has not yet established itself, just because
the Christian religious perception was not one of
those small steps by which humanity advances regularly,
but was an enormous revolution, which, if it has not
already altered, must inevitably alter the entire life-conception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
of mankind, and, consequently, the whole internal
organization of their life. It is true that the life
of humanity, like that of an individual, moves regularly;
but in that regular movement come, as it were, turning-points,
which sharply divide the preceding from the
subsequent life. Christianity was such a turning-point;
such, at least, it must appear to us who live by the Christian
perception of life. Christian perception gave another,
a new, direction to all human feelings, and
therefore completely altered both the contents and the
significance of art. The Greeks could make use of
Persian art and the Romans could use Greek art, or,
similarly, the Jews could use Egyptian art,&mdash;the fundamental
ideals were one and the same. Now the ideal
was the greatness and prosperity of the Persians, now
the greatness and prosperity of the Greeks, now that of
the Romans. The same art was transferred into other
conditions, and served new nations. But the Christian
ideal changed and reversed everything, so that, as the
gospel puts it, "That which was exalted among men
has become an abomination in the sight of God." The
ideal is no longer the greatness of Pharaoh or of a Roman
emperor, not the beauty of a Greek, nor the wealth of
Ph&oelig;nicia, but humility, purity, compassion, love. The
hero is no longer Dives, but Lazarus the beggar; not
Mary Magdalene in the day of her beauty, but in the
day of her repentance; not those who acquire wealth,
but those who have abandoned it; not those who dwell
in palaces, but those who dwell in catacombs and huts;
not those who rule over others, but those who acknowledge
no authority but God's. And the greatest work
of art is no longer a cathedral of victory<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> with statues of
conquerors, but the representation of a human soul so
transformed by love that a man who is tormented and
murdered yet pities and loves his persecutors.</p>

<p>And the change is so great that men of the Christian
world find it difficult to resist the inertia of the heathen
art to which they have been accustomed all their lives.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
The subject-matter of Christian religious art is so new
to them, so unlike the subject-matter of former art, that
it seems to them as though Christian art were a denial
of art, and they cling desperately to the old art. But
this old art, having no longer, in our day, any source in
religious perception, has lost its meaning, and we shall
have to abandon it whether we wish to or not.</p>

<p>The essence of the Christian perception consists in
the recognition by every man of his sonship to God, and
of the consequent union of men with God and with one
another, as is said in the gospel (John xvii. 21<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>). Therefore
the subject-matter of Christian art is such feeling
as can unite men with God and with one another.</p>

<p>The expression <i>unite men with God and with one
another</i> may seem obscure to people accustomed to the
misuse of these words which is so customary, but the
words have a perfectly clear meaning nevertheless.
They indicate that the Christian union of man (in contradiction
to the partial, exclusive union of only some
men) is that which unites all without exception.</p>

<p>Art, all art, has this characteristic, that it unites people.
Every art causes those to whom the artist's feeling
is transmitted to unite in soul with the artist, and also
with all who receive the same impression. But non-Christian
art, while uniting some people together, makes
that very union a cause of separation between these
united people and others; so that union of this kind is
often a source, not only of division, but even of enmity
toward others. Such is all patriotic art, with its
anthems, poems, and monuments; such is all Church
art, <i>i.e.</i> the art of certain cults, with their images, statues,
processions, and other local ceremonies. Such art is
belated and non-Christian art, uniting the people of one
cult only to separate them yet more sharply from the
members of other cults, and even to place them in relations
of hostility to each other. Christian art is only
such as tends to unite all without exception, either by
evoking in them the perception that each man and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
men stand in like relation toward God and toward
their neighbor, or by evoking in them identical feelings,
which may even be the very simplest, provided only that
they are not repugnant to Christianity and are natural
to every one without exception.</p>

<p>Good Christian art of our time may be unintelligible
to people because of imperfections in its form, or because
men are inattentive to it, but it must be such that all men
can experience the feelings it transmits. It must be the
art, not of some one group of people, nor of one class,
nor of one nationality, nor of one religious cult; that is,
it must not transmit feelings which are accessible only to
a man educated in a certain way, or only to an aristocrat,
or a merchant, or only to a Russian, or a native of Japan,
or a Roman Catholic, or a Buddhist, etc., but it must
transmit feelings accessible to every one. Only art of
this kind can be acknowledged in our time to be good
art, worthy of being chosen out from all the rest of art
and encouraged.</p>

<p>Christian art, <i>i.e.</i> the art of our time, should be catholic
in the original meaning of the word, <i>i.e.</i> universal, and
therefore it should unite all men. And only two kinds
of feeling do unite all men: first, feelings flowing from
the perception of our sonship to God and of the brotherhood
of man; and next, the simple feelings of common
life, accessible to every one without exception&mdash;such as
the feeling of merriment, of pity, of cheerfulness, of
tranquillity, etc. Only these two kinds of feelings can
now supply material for art good in its subject-matter.</p>

<p>And the action of these two kinds of art, apparently
so dissimilar, is one and the same. The feelings flowing
from perception of our sonship to God and of the
brotherhood of man&mdash;such as a feeling of sureness in
truth, devotion to the will of God, self-sacrifice, respect
for and love of man&mdash;evoked by Christian religious perception;
and the simplest feelings&mdash;such as a softened
or a merry mood caused by a song or an amusing jest
intelligible to every one, or by a touching story, or a
drawing, or a little doll: both alike produce one and the
same effect,&mdash;the loving union of man with man. Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
people who are together are, if not hostile to one
another, at least estranged in mood and feeling, till perchance
a story, a performance, a picture, or even a
building, but oftenest of all, music, unites them all as by
an electric flash, and, in place of their former isolation
or even enmity, they are all conscious of union and
mutual love. Each is glad that another feels what he
feels; glad of the communion established, not only
between him and all present, but also with all now living
who will yet share the same impression; and more
than that, he feels the mysterious gladness of a communion
which, reaching beyond the grave, unites us
with all men of the past who have been moved by the
same feelings, and with all men of the future who will
yet be touched by them. And this effect is produced
both by the religious art which transmits feelings of love
to God and one's neighbor, and by universal art, transmitting
the very simplest feelings common to all men.</p>

<p>The art of our time should be appraised differently from
former art chiefly in this, that the art of our time, <i>i.e.</i>
Christian art (basing itself on a religious perception which
demands the union of man), excludes from the domain of
art good in subject-matter everything transmitting exclusive
feelings, which do not unite but divide men. It
relegates such work to the category of art bad in its
subject-matter, while, on the other hand, it includes in
the category of art good in subject-matter a section not
formerly admitted to deserve to be chosen out and respected,
namely, universal art, transmitting even the
most trifling and simple feelings if only they are accessible
to all men without exception, and therefore unite
them. Such art cannot, in our time, but be esteemed
good, for it attains the end which the religious perception
of our time, <i>i.e.</i> Christianity, sets before humanity.</p>

<p>Christian art either evokes in men those feelings which,
through love of God and of one's neighbor, draw them
to greater and ever greater union, and make them ready
for and capable of such union; or evokes in them those
feelings which show them that they are already united in
the joys and sorrows of life. And therefore the Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
art of our time can be and is of two kinds: (1) art transmitting
feelings flowing from a religious perception of
man's position in the world in relation to God and to his
neighbor&mdash;religious art in the limited meaning of the
term; and (2) art transmitting the simplest feelings of
common life, but such, always, as are accessible to all men
in the whole world&mdash;the art of common life&mdash;the art of
a people&mdash;universal art. Only these two kinds of art
can be considered good art in our time.</p>

<p>The first, religious art,&mdash;transmitting both positive
feelings of love to God and one's neighbor, and negative
feelings of indignation and horror at the violation of
love,&mdash;manifests itself chiefly in the form of words, and
to some extent also in painting and sculpture: the second
kind (universal art), transmitting feelings accessible to
all, manifests itself in words, in painting, in sculpture,
in dances, in architecture, and, most of all, in music.</p>

<p>If I were asked to give modern examples of each of
these kinds of art, then, as examples of the highest art,
flowing from love of God and man (both of the higher,
positive, and of the lower, negative kind), in literature
I should name, "The Robbers," by Schiller; Victor
Hugo's "Les Pauvres Gens" and "Les Misérables"; the
novels and stories of Dickens,&mdash;"The Tale of Two
Cities," "The Christmas Carol," "The Chimes," and
others; "Uncle Tom's Cabin;" Dostoievsky's works&mdash;especially
his "Memoirs from the House of Death";
and "Adam Bede," by George Eliot.</p>

<p>In modern painting, strange to say, works of this kind,
directly transmitting the Christian feeling of love of God
and of one's neighbor, are hardly to be found, especially
among the works of the celebrated painters. There are
plenty of pictures treating of the gospel stories; they,
however, depict historical events with great wealth of
detail, but do not, and cannot, transmit religious feeling
not possessed by their painters. There are many pictures
treating of the personal feelings of various people,
but of pictures representing great deeds of self-sacrifice
and of Christian love there are very few, and what there
are, are principally by artists who are not celebrated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
and are, for the most part, not pictures, but merely
sketches. Such, for instance, is the drawing by Kramskoy
(worth many of his finished pictures), showing a
drawing-room with a balcony, past which troops are
marching in triumph on their return from the war. On
the balcony stands a wet-nurse holding a baby and a boy.
They are admiring the procession of the troops, but the
mother, covering her face with a handkerchief, has fallen
back on the sofa, sobbing. Such also is the picture by
Walter Langley, to which I have already referred, and
such again is a picture by the French artist Morlon, depicting
a lifeboat hastening, in a heavy storm, to the relief
of a steamer that is being wrecked. Approaching these
in kind are pictures which represent the hard-working
peasant with respect and love. Such are the pictures
by Millet, and, particularly, his drawing, "The Man with
the Hoe"; also pictures in this style by Jules Breton,
L'Hermitte, Defregger, and others. As examples of
pictures evoking indignation and horror at the violation
of love to God and man, Gay's picture, "Judgment,"
may serve, and also Leizen-Mayer's, "Signing the Death
Warrant." But there are also very few of this kind.
Anxiety about the technique and the beauty of the picture
for the most part obscures the feeling. For instance,
Gérôme's "Pollice Verso" expresses, not so much horror
at what is being perpetrated as attraction by the beauty
of the spectacle.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>To give examples, from the modern art of our upper
classes, of art of the second kind, good universal art or
even of the art of a whole people, is yet more difficult,
especially in literary art and music. If there are some
works which by their inner contents might be assigned
to this class (such as "Don Quixote," Molière's comedies,
"David Copperfield" and "The Pickwick Papers"
by Dickens, Gogol's and Pushkin's tales, and some
things of Maupassant's), these works are for the most
part&mdash;from the exceptional nature of the feelings they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
transmit, and the superfluity of special details of time
and locality, and, above all, on account of the poverty
of their subject-matter in comparison with examples of
universal ancient art (such, for instance, as the story of
Joseph)&mdash;comprehensible only to people of their own
circle. That Joseph's brethren, being jealous of his
father's affection, sell him to the merchants; that Potiphar's
wife wishes to tempt the youth; that having attained
the highest station, he takes pity on his brothers,
including Benjamin, the favorite,&mdash;these and all the rest
are feelings accessible alike to a Russian peasant, a Chinese,
an African, a child, or an old man, educated or uneducated;
and it is all written with such restraint, is so
free from any superfluous detail, that the story may be
told to any circle and will be equally comprehensible and
touching to every one. But not such are the feelings of
Don Quixote or of Molière's heroes (though Molière is
perhaps the most universal, and therefore the most excellent,
artist of modern times), nor of Pickwick and his
friends. These feelings are not common to all men, but
very exceptional; and therefore, to make them infectious,
the authors have surrounded them with abundant details
of time and place. And this abundance of detail makes
the stories difficult of comprehension to all people not living
within reach of the conditions described by the author.</p>

<p>The author of the novel of Joseph did not need to
describe in detail, as would be done nowadays, the
blood-stained coat of Joseph, the dwelling and dress
of Jacob, the pose and attire of Potiphar's wife, and
how, adjusting the bracelet on her left arm, she said,
"Come to me," and so on, because the subject-matter
of feelings in this novel is so strong that all details,
except the most essential,&mdash;such as that Joseph went
out into another room to weep,&mdash;are superfluous, and
would only hinder the transmission of feelings. And
therefore this novel is accessible to all men, touches
people of all nations and classes, young and old, and
has lasted to our times, and will yet last for thousands
of years to come. But strip the best novels of
our times of their details, and what will remain?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span></p>

<p>It is therefore impossible in modern literature to indicate
works fully satisfying the demands of universality.
Such works as exist are, to a great extent,
spoilt by what is usually called "realism," but would
be better termed "provincialism," in art.</p>

<p>In music the same occurs as in verbal art, and for
similar reasons. In consequence of the poorness of
the feeling they contain, the melodies of the modern
composers are amazingly empty and insignificant.
And to strengthen the impression produced by these
empty melodies, the new musicians pile complex modulations
on to each trivial melody, not only in their
own national manner, but also in the way characteristic
of their own exclusive circle and particular
musical school. Melody&mdash;every melody&mdash;is free, and
may be understood of all men; but as soon as it is
bound up with a particular harmony, it ceases to be
accessible except to people trained to such harmony,
and it becomes strange, not only to common men of
another nationality, but to all who do not belong to
the circle whose members have accustomed themselves
to certain forms of harmonization. So that music, like
poetry, travels in a vicious circle. Trivial and exclusive
melodies, in order to make them attractive, are
laden with harmonic, rhythmic, and orchestral complications,
and thus become yet more exclusive; and,
far from being universal, are not even national, <i>i.e.</i>
they are not comprehensible to the whole people but
only to some people.</p>

<p>In music, besides marches and dances by various
composers, which satisfy the demands of universal art,
one can indicate very few works of this class: Bach's
famous violin <i>aria</i>, Chopin's nocturne in E-flat major,
and perhaps a dozen bits (not whole pieces, but parts)
selected from the works of Haydn, Mozart, Schubert,
Beethoven, and Chopin.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span></p>
<p>Although in painting the same thing is repeated as
in poetry and music,&mdash;namely, that in order to make
them more interesting, works weak in conception are
surrounded by minutely studied accessories of time and
place, which give them a temporary and local interest
but make them less universal,&mdash;still, in painting, more
than in the other spheres of art, may be found works
satisfying the demands of universal Christian art;
that is to say, there are more works expressing feelings
in which all men may participate.</p>

<p>In the arts of painting and sculpture, all pictures and
statues in so-called genre style, depictions of animals,
landscapes and caricatures with subjects comprehensible
to every one, and also all kinds of ornaments, are
universal in subject-matter. Such productions in painting
and sculpture are very numerous (<i>e.g.</i> china dolls),
but for the most part such objects (for instance, ornaments
of all kinds) are either not considered to be art
or are considered to be art of a low quality. In reality
all such objects, if only they transmit a true feeling
experienced by the artist and comprehensible to every
one (however insignificant it may seem to us to be) are
works of real good Christian art.</p>

<p>I fear it will here be urged against me that having
denied that the conception of beauty can supply a
standard for works of art, I contradict myself by acknowledging
ornaments to be works of good art. The
reproach is unjust, for the subject-matter of all kinds of
ornamentation consists not in the beauty, but in the feeling
(of admiration of, and delight in, the combination of
lines and colors) which the artist has experienced and
with which he infects the spectator. Art remains what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
it was and what it must be: nothing but the infection by
one man of another, or of others, with the feelings experienced
by the infector. Among those feelings is the
feeling of delight at what pleases the sight. Objects
pleasing the sight may be such as please a small or
a large number of people, or such as please all men.
And ornaments for the most part are of the latter kind.
A landscape representing a very unusual view, or a
genre picture of a special subject, may not please every
one, but ornaments, from Yakutsk ornaments to Greek
ones, are intelligible to every one and evoke a similar
feeling of admiration in all, and therefore this despised
kind of art should, in Christian society, be esteemed far
above exceptional, pretentious pictures and sculptures.</p>

<p>So that there are only two kinds of good Christian
art: all the rest of art not comprised in these two divisions
should be acknowledged to be bad art, deserving
not to be encouraged, but to be driven out, denied, and
despised, as being art not uniting but dividing people.
Such, in literary art, are all novels and poems which
transmit Church or patriotic feelings, and also exclusive
feelings pertaining only to the class of the idle rich;
such as aristocratic honor, satiety, spleen, pessimism,
and refined and vicious feelings flowing from sex-love&mdash;quite
incomprehensible to the great majority of mankind.</p>

<p>In painting we must similarly place in the class of
bad art all the Church, patriotic, and exclusive pictures;
all the pictures representing the amusements and allurements
of a rich and idle life; all the so-called symbolic
pictures, in which the very meaning of the symbol is
comprehensible only to the people of a certain circle;
and, above all, pictures with voluptuous subjects&mdash;all
that odious female nudity which fills all the exhibitions
and galleries. And to this class belongs almost all the
chamber and opera music of our times,&mdash;beginning
especially from Beethoven (Schumann, Berlioz, Liszt,
Wagner), by its subject-matter devoted to the expression
of feelings accessible only to people who have
developed in themselves an unhealthy, nervous irritation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
evoked by this exclusive, artificial, and complex
music.</p>

<p>"What! the '<i>Ninth Symphony</i>' not a good work of
art!" I hear exclaimed by indignant voices.</p>

<p>And I reply, Most certainly it is not. All that I
have written I have written with the sole purpose of
finding a clear and reasonable criterion by which to
judge the merits of works of art. And this criterion,
coinciding with the indications of plain and sane sense,
indubitably shows me that that symphony by Beethoven
is not a good work of art. Of course, to people educated
in the adoration of certain productions and of
their authors, to people whose taste has been perverted
just by being educated in such adoration, the acknowledgment
that such a celebrated work is bad is amazing
and strange. But how are we to escape the indications
of reason and of common sense?</p>

<p>Beethoven's "Ninth Symphony" is considered a great
work of art. To verify its claim to be such, I must first
ask myself whether this work transmits the highest
religious feeling? I reply in the negative, for music in
itself cannot transmit those feelings; and therefore I
ask myself next, Since this work does not belong to the
highest kind of religious art, has it the other characteristic
of the good art of our time,&mdash;the quality of uniting
all men in one common feeling: does it rank as Christian
universal art? And again I have no option but to reply
in the negative; for not only do I not see how the feelings
transmitted by this work could unite people not
specially trained to submit themselves to its complex
hypnotism, but I am unable to imagine to myself a
crowd of normal people who could understand anything
of this long, confused, and artificial production, except
short snatches which are lost in a sea of what is incomprehensible.
And therefore, whether I like it or not, I
am compelled to conclude that this work belongs to the
rank of bad art. It is curious to note in this connection,
that attached to the end of this very symphony is a
poem of Schiller's which (though somewhat obscurely)
expresses this very thought, namely, that feeling (Schiller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
speaks only of the feeling of gladness) unites people
and evokes love in them. But though this poem is sung
at the end of the symphony, the music does not accord
with the thought expressed in the verses; for the music
is exclusive and does not unite all men, but unites only
a few, dividing them off from the rest of mankind.</p>

<p>And just in this same way, in all branches of art,
many and many works considered great by the upper
classes of our society will have to be judged. By
this one sure criterion we shall have to judge the celebrated
"Divine Comedy" and "Jerusalem Delivered,"
and a great part of Shakespear's and Goethe's works,
and in painting every representation of miracles, including
Raphael's "Transfiguration," etc.</p>

<p>Whatever the work may be and however it may have
been extolled, we have first to ask whether this work is
one of real art or a counterfeit. Having acknowledged,
on the basis of the indication of its infectiousness even
to a small class of people, that a certain production belongs
to the realm of art, it is necessary, on the basis of
the indication of its accessibility, to decide the next question,
Does this work belong to the category of bad,
exclusive art, opposed to religious perception, or to
Christian art, uniting people? And having acknowledged
an article to belong to real Christian art, we must
then, according to whether it transmits the feelings flowing
from love to God and man, or merely the simple
feelings uniting all men, assign it a place in the ranks of
religious art or in those of universal art.</p>

<p>Only on the basis of such verification shall we find it
possible to select from the whole mass of what, in our
society, claims to be art, those works which form real,
important, necessary spiritual food, and to separate them
from all the harmful and useless art, and from the counterfeits
of art which surround us. Only on the basis of
such verification shall we be able to rid ourselves of the
pernicious results of harmful art, and to avail ourselves
of that beneficent action which is the purpose of true
and good art, and which is indispensable for the spiritual
life of man and of humanity.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>


<p>Art is one of two organs of human progress. By
words man interchanges thoughts, by the forms of art
he interchanges feelings, and this with all men, not only
of the present time, but also of the past and the future.
It is natural to human beings to employ both these
organs of intercommunication, and therefore the perversion
of either of them must cause evil results to the
society in which it occurs. And these results will be of
two kinds: first, the absence, in that society, of the
work which should be performed by the organ; and
secondly, the harmful activity of the perverted organ.
And just these results have shown themselves in our
society. The organ of art has been perverted, and
therefore the upper classes of society have, to a great
extent, been deprived of the work that it should have
performed. The diffusion in our society of enormous
quantities of, on the one hand, those counterfeits of art
which only serve to amuse and corrupt people, and, on
the other hand, of works of insignificant, exclusive art,
mistaken for the highest art, have perverted most men's
capacity to be infected by true works of art, and have
thus deprived them of the possibility of experiencing
the highest feelings to which mankind has attained, and
which can only be transmitted from man to man by
art.</p>

<p>All the best that has been done in art by man remains
strange to people who lack the capacity to be infected
by art, and is replaced either by spurious counterfeits
of art or by insignificant art, which they mistake for
real art. People of our time and of our society are
delighted with Baudelaires, Verlaines, Moréases, Ibsens,
and Maeterlincks in poetry; with Monets, Manets, Puvis
de Chavannes, Burne-Joneses, Stucks, and Böcklins in
painting; with Wagners, Liszts, Richard Strausses, in
music; and they are no longer capable of comprehending
either the highest or the simplest art.</p>

<p>In the upper classes, in consequence of this loss of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
capacity to be infected by works of art, people grow
up, are educated, and live, lacking the fertilizing, improving
influence of art, and therefore not only do not
advance toward perfection, do not become kinder, but,
on the contrary, possessing highly developed external
means of civilization, they yet tend to become continually
more savage, more coarse, and more cruel.</p>

<p>Such is the result of the absence from our society of
the activity of that essential organ&mdash;art. But the
consequences of the perverted activity of that organ
are yet more harmful. And they are numerous.</p>

<p>The first consequence, plain for all to see, is the
enormous expenditure of the labor of working people
on things which are not only useless, but which, for
the most part, are harmful; and more than that, the
waste of priceless human lives on this unnecessary and
harmful business. It is terrible to consider with what
intensity, and amid what privations, millions of people&mdash;who
lack time and opportunity to attend to what
they and their families urgently require&mdash;labor for 10,
12, or 14 hours on end, and even at night, setting the
type for pseudo-artistic books which spread vice among
mankind, or working for theaters, concerts, exhibitions,
and picture-galleries, which, for the most part, also
serve vice; but it is yet more terrible to reflect that
lively, kindly children, capable of all that is good, are
devoted from their early years to such tasks as these:
that for 6, 8, or 10 hours a day, and for 10 or 15 years,
some of them should play scales and exercises; others
should twist their limbs, walk on their toes, and lift
their legs above their heads; a third set should sing
solfeggios; a fourth set, showing themselves off in all
manner of ways, should pronounce verses; a fifth set
should draw from busts or from nude models and paint
studies; a sixth set should write compositions according
to the rules of certain periods; and that in these
occupations, unworthy of a human being, which are
often continued long after full maturity, they should
waste their physical and mental strength and lose all
perception of the meaning of life. It is often said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
it is horrible and pitiful to see little acrobats putting
their legs over their necks, but it is not less pitiful to
see children of 10 giving concerts, and it is still worse
to see school-boys of 10 who, as a preparation for
literary work, have learnt by heart the exceptions to
the Latin grammar. These people not only grow
physically and mentally deformed, but also morally
deformed, and become incapable of doing anything
really needed by man. Occupying in society the rôle
of amusers of the rich, they lose their sense of human
dignity, and develop in themselves such a passion for
public applause that they are always a prey to an inflated
and unsatisfied vanity which grows in them to
diseased dimensions, and they expend their mental
strength in efforts to obtain satisfaction for this passion.
And what is most tragic of all is that these people, who
for the sake of art are spoilt for life, not only do not
render service to this art, but, on the contrary, inflict
the greatest harm on it. They are taught in academies,
schools, and conservatoires how to counterfeit art, and
by learning this they so pervert themselves that they
quite lose the capacity to produce works of real art, and
become purveyors of that counterfeit, or trivial, or depraved
art which floods our society. This is the first
obvious consequence of the perversion of the organ of
art.</p>

<p>The second consequence is that the productions of
amusement-art, which are prepared in such terrific
quantities by the armies of professional artists, enable
the rich people of our times to live the lives they do,
lives not only unnatural, but in contradiction to the humane
principles these people themselves profess. To
live as do the rich, idle people, especially the women,
far from nature and from animals, in artificial conditions,
with muscles atrophied or misdeveloped by gymnastics,
and with enfeebled vital energy, would be impossible
were it not for what is called art&mdash;for this occupation
and amusement which hides from them the meaninglessness
of their lives, and saves them from the dullness
that oppresses them. Take from all these people the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
theaters, concerts, exhibitions, piano-playing, songs, and
novels with which they now fill their time, in full confidence
that occupation with these things is a very refined,
æsthetical, and therefore good occupation; take from
the patrons of art who buy pictures, assist musicians,
and are acquainted with writers, their rôle of protectors
of that important matter art, and they will not be able
to continue such a life, but will all be eaten up by ennui
and spleen, and will become conscious of the meaninglessness
and wrongness of their present mode of life.
Only occupation with what, among them, is considered
art renders it possible for them to continue to live on,
infringing all natural conditions, without perceiving the
emptiness and cruelty of their lives. And this support
afforded to the false manner of life pursued by the rich
is the second consequence, and a serious one, of the
perversion of art.</p>

<p>The third consequence of the perversion of art is the
perplexity produced in the minds of children and of
plain folk. Among people not perverted by the false
theories of our society, among workers and children,
there exists a very definite conception of what people
may be respected and praised for. In the minds of
peasants and children the ground for praise or eulogy
can only be either physical strength: Hercules, the
heroes and conquerors; or moral, spiritual, strength:
Sakya Muni giving up a beautiful wife and a kingdom
to save mankind, Christ going to the cross for the truth
he professed, and all the martyrs and the saints. Both
are understood by peasants and children. They understand
that physical strength must be respected, for it
compels respect; and the moral strength of goodness
an unperverted man cannot fail to respect, because all
his spiritual being draws him toward it. But these
people, children, and peasants, suddenly perceive that
besides those praised, respected, and rewarded for
physical or moral strength, there are others who are
praised, extolled, and rewarded much more than the
heroes of strength and virtue, merely because they sing
well, compose verses, or dance. They see that singers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
composers, painters, ballet-dancers, earn millions of roubles
and receive more honor than the saints do: and
peasants and children are perplexed.</p>

<p>When fifty years had elapsed after Pushkin's death,
and, simultaneously, the cheap edition of his works began
to circulate among the people and a monument was
erected to him in Moscow, I received more than a dozen
letters from different peasants asking why Pushkin was
raised to such dignity. And only the other day a literate<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
man from Saratoff called on me who had evidently
gone out of his mind over this very question. He was
on his way to Moscow to expose the clergy for having
taken part in raising a "monament" to Mr. Pushkin.</p>

<p>Indeed, one need only imagine to oneself what the
state of mind of such a man of the people must be
when he learns, from such rumors and newspapers as
reach him, that the clergy, the Government officials,
and all the best people in Russia are triumphantly unveiling
a statue to a great man, the benefactor, the
pride of Russia&mdash;Pushkin, of whom till then he had
never heard. From all sides he reads or hears about
this, and he naturally supposes that if such honors are
rendered to any one, then without doubt he must have
done something extraordinary&mdash;either some feat of
strength or of goodness. He tries to learn who Pushkin
was, and having discovered that Pushkin was neither
a hero nor a general, but was a private person and a
writer, he comes to the conclusion that Pushkin must
have been a holy man and a teacher of goodness, and
he hastens to read or to hear his life and works. But
what must be his perplexity when he learns that Pushkin
was a man of more than easy morals, who was killed
in a duel, <i>i.e.</i> when attempting to murder another man,
and that all his service consisted in writing verses about
love, which were often very indecent.</p>

<p>That a hero, or Alexander the Great, or Genghis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
Khan, or Napoleon were great, he understands, because
any one of them could have crushed him and a
thousand like him; that Buddha, Socrates, and Christ
were great he also understands, for he knows and feels
that he and all men should be such as they were; but
why a man should be great because he wrote verses
about the love of women he cannot make out.</p>

<p>A similar perplexity must trouble the brain of a Breton
or Norman peasant who hears that a monument, "<i>une
statue</i>" (as to the Madonna), is being erected to Baudelaire,
and reads, or is told, what the contents of his
"Fleurs du Mal" are; or, more amazing still, to Verlaine,
when he learns the story of that man's wretched,
vicious life, and reads his verses. And what confusion
it must cause in the brains of peasants when they learn
that some Patti or Taglioni is paid £10,000 for a season,
or that a painter gets as much for a picture, or
that authors of novels describing love-scenes have
received even more than that.</p>

<p>And it is the same with children. I remember how I
passed through this stage of amazement and stupefaction,
and only reconciled myself to this exaltation of
artists to the level of heroes and saints by lowering in
my own estimation the importance of moral excellence,
and by attributing a false, unnatural meaning to works of
art. And a similar confusion must occur in the soul of
each child and each man of the people when he learns
of the strange honors and rewards that are lavished on
artists. This is the third consequence of the false relation
in which our society stands toward art.</p>

<p>The fourth consequence is that people of the upper
classes, more and more frequently encountering the contradictions
between beauty and goodness, put the ideal
of beauty first, thus freeing themselves from the demands
of morality. These people, reversing the rôles,
instead of admitting, as is really the case, that the art
they serve is an antiquated affair, allege that morality is
an antiquated affair, which can have no importance for
people situated on that high plane of development on
which they opine that they are situated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span></p>

<p>This result of the false relation to art showed itself
in our society long ago; but recently, with its prophet
Nietzsche and his adherents, and with the decadents
and certain English æsthetes who coincide with him,
it is being expressed with especial impudence. The
decadents, and æsthetes of the type at one time represented
by Oscar Wilde, select as a theme for their
productions the denial of morality and the laudation
of vice.</p>

<p>This art has partly generated, and partly coincides
with, a similar philosophic theory. I recently received
from America a book entitled, "The Survival of the
Fittest: Philosophy of Power," 1896, by Ragnar Redbeard,
Chicago. The substance of this book, as it is
expressed in the editor's preface, is that to measure
"right" by the false philosophy of the Hebrew prophets
and "weepful" Messiahs is madness. Right is not the
offspring of doctrine, but of power. All laws, commandments,
or doctrines as to not doing to another
what you do not wish done to you, have no inherent
authority whatever, but receive it only from the club,
the gallows, and the sword. A man truly free is under
no obligation to obey any injunction, human or divine.
Obedience is the sign of the degenerate. Disobedience
is the stamp of the hero. Men should not be bound
by moral rules invented by their foes. The whole world
is a slippery battlefield. Ideal justice demands that the
vanquished should be exploited, emasculated, and scorned.
The free and brave may seize the world. And, therefore,
there should be eternal war for life, for land, for
love, for women, for power, and for gold. (Something
similar was said a few years ago by the celebrated and
refined academician, Vogüé.) The earth and its treasures
is "booty for the bold."</p>

<p>The author has evidently by himself, independently
of Nietzsche, come to the same conclusions which are
professed by the new artists.</p>

<p>Expressed in the form of a doctrine these positions
startle us. In reality they are implied in the ideal of
art serving beauty. The art of our upper classes has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
educated people in this ideal of the over-man,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>&mdash;which
is, in reality, the old ideal of Nero, Stenka Razin,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Genghis
Khan, Robert Macaire,<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> or Napoleon, and all their
accomplices, assistants, and adulators&mdash;and it supports
this ideal with all its might.</p>

<p>It is this supplanting of the ideal of what is right by
the ideal of what is beautiful, <i>i.e.</i> of what is pleasant,
that is the fourth consequence, and a terrible one, of
the perversion of art in our society. It is fearful to
think of what would befall humanity were such art to
spread among the masses of the people. And it already
begins to spread.</p>

<p>Finally, the fifth and chief result is, that the art which
flourishes in the upper classes of European society has
a directly vitiating influence, infecting people with the
worst feelings and with those most harmful to humanity,&mdash;superstition,
patriotism, and, above all, sensuality.</p>

<p>Look carefully into the causes of the ignorance of the
masses, and you may see that the chief cause does not
at all lie in the lack of schools and libraries, as we are
accustomed to suppose, but in those superstitions, both
ecclesiastical and patriotic, with which the people are
saturated, and which are unceasingly generated by all
the methods of art. Church superstitions are supported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
and produced by the poetry of prayers, hymns, painting,
by the sculpture of images and of statues, by singing, by
organs, by music, by architecture, and even by dramatic
art in religious ceremonies. Patriotic superstitions are
supported and produced by verses and stories, which
are supplied even in schools, by music, by songs, by
triumphal processions, by royal meetings, by martial
pictures, and by monuments.</p>

<p>Were it not for this continual activity in all departments
of art, perpetuating the ecclesiastical and patriotic
intoxication and embitterment of the people, the masses
would long ere this have attained to true enlightenment.</p>

<p>But it is not only in Church matters and patriotic
matters that art depraves; it is art in our time that
serves as the chief cause of the perversion of people in
the most important question of social life,&mdash;in their sexual
relations. We nearly all know by our own experience,
and those who are fathers and mothers know in
the case of their grown-up children also, what fearful
mental and physical suffering, what useless waste of
strength, people suffer merely as a consequence of dissoluteness
in sexual desire.</p>

<p>Since the world began, since the Trojan war, which
sprang from that same sexual dissoluteness, down to and
including the suicides and murders of lovers described in
almost every newspaper, a great proportion of the sufferings
of the human race have come from this source.</p>

<p>And what is art doing? All art, real and counterfeit,
with very few exceptions, is devoted to describing, depicting,
and inflaming sexual love in every shape and form.
When one remembers all those novels and their lust-kindling
descriptions of love, from the most refined to
the grossest, with which the literature of our society
overflows; if one only remembers all those pictures and
statues representing women's naked bodies, and all sorts
of abominations which are reproduced in illustrations
and advertisements; if one only remembers all the filthy
operas and operettas, songs, and <i>romances</i> with which
our world teems, involuntarily it seems as if existing art<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
had but one definite aim,&mdash;to disseminate vice as widely
as possible.</p>

<p>Such, though not all, are the most direct consequences
of that perversion of art which has occurred in our society.
So that what in our society is called art not only does
not conduce to the progress of mankind, but, more than
almost anything else, hinders the attainment of goodness
in our lives.</p>

<p>And therefore the question which involuntarily presents
itself to every man free from artistic activity and
therefore not bound to existing art by self-interest, the
question asked by me at the beginning of this work: Is
it just that to what we call art, to a something belonging
to but a small section of society, should be offered up
such sacrifices of human labor, of human lives, and of
goodness as are now being offered up? receives the
natural reply: No; it is unjust, and these things should
not be! So also replies sound sense and unperverted
moral feeling. Not only should these things not be, not
only should no sacrifices be offered up to what among us
is called art, but, on the contrary, the efforts of those
who wish to live rightly should be directed toward the
destruction of this art, for it is one of the most cruel of
the evils that harass our section of humanity. So that,
were the question put: Would it be preferable for our
Christian world to be deprived of <i>all</i> that is now esteemed
to be art, and, together with the false, to lose <i>all</i> that is
good in it? I think that every reasonable and moral man
would again decide the question as Plato decided it for
his "Republic," and as all the Church Christian and Mohammedan
teachers of mankind decided it, <i>i.e.</i> would
say, "Rather let there be no art at all than continue the
depraving art, or simulation of art, which now exists."
Happily, no one has to face this question, and no one
need adopt either solution. All that man can do, and
that we&mdash;the so-called educated people, who are so
placed that we have the possibility of understanding the
meaning of the phenomena of our life&mdash;can and should
do, is to understand the error we are involved in, and
not harden our hearts in it, but seek for a way of escape.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>


<p>The cause of the lie into which the art of our society
has fallen was that people of the upper classes, having
ceased to believe in the Church teaching (called Christian),
did not resolve to accept true Christian teaching
in its real and fundamental principles of sonship to God
and brotherhood to man, but continued to live on without
any belief, endeavoring to make up for the absence
of belief&mdash;some by hypocrisy, pretending still to believe
in the nonsense of the Church creeds; others by boldly
asserting their disbelief; others by refined agnosticism;
and others, again, by returning to the Greek worship of
beauty, proclaiming egotism to be right, and elevating it
to the rank of a religious doctrine.</p>

<p>The cause of the malady was the non-acceptance of
Christ's teaching in its real, <i>i.e.</i> its full, meaning. And
the only cure for the illness lies in acknowledging that
teaching in its full meaning. And such acknowledgment
in our time is not only possible, but inevitable.
Already to-day a man, standing on the height of the
knowledge of our age, whether he be nominally a Catholic
or a Protestant, cannot say that he really believes in
the dogmas of the Church: in God being a Trinity, in
Christ being God, in the scheme of redemption, and so
forth; nor can he satisfy himself by proclaiming his unbelief
or skepticism, nor by relapsing into the worship
of beauty and egotism. Above all, he can no longer
say that we do not know the real meaning of Christ's
teaching. That meaning has not only become accessible
to all men of our times, but the whole life of man to-day
is permeated by the spirit of that teaching, and, consciously
or unconsciously, is guided by it.</p>

<p>However differently in form people belonging to our
Christian world may define the destiny of man; whether
they see it in human progress in whatever sense of the
words, in the union of all men in a socialistic realm, or
in the establishment of a commune; whether they look
forward to the union of mankind under the guidance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
one universal Church, or to the federation of the world,&mdash;however
various in form their definitions of the destination
of human life may be, all men in our times already
admit that the highest well-being attainable by men is
to be reached by their union with one another.</p>

<p>However people of our upper classes (feeling that
their ascendancy can only be maintained as long as they
separate themselves&mdash;the rich and learned&mdash;from the
laborers, the poor, and the unlearned) may seek to devise
new conceptions of life by which their privileges may
be perpetuated,&mdash;now the ideal of returning to antiquity,
now mysticism, now Hellenism, now the cult of the superior
person (over-man-ism),&mdash;they have, willingly or
unwillingly, to admit the truth which is elucidating itself
from all sides, voluntarily and involuntarily, namely, that
our welfare lies only in the unification and the brotherhood
of man.</p>

<p>Unconsciously this truth is confirmed by the construction
of means of communication,&mdash;telegraphs, telephones,
the press, and the ever increasing attainability of material
well-being for every one,&mdash;and consciously it is affirmed
by the destruction of superstitions which divide men, by
the diffusion of the truths of knowledge, and by the
expression of the ideal of the brotherhood of man in the
best works of art of our time.</p>

<p>Art is a spiritual organ of human life which cannot
be destroyed, and therefore, notwithstanding all the
efforts made by people of the upper classes to conceal
the religious ideal by which humanity lives, that ideal is
more and more clearly recognized by man, and even in
our perverted society is more and more often partially
expressed by science and by art. During the present
century works of the higher kind of religious art have
appeared more and more frequently, both in literature
and in painting, permeated by a truly Christian spirit, as
also works of the universal art of common life, accessible
to all. So that even art knows the true ideal of our
times, and tends toward it. On the one hand, the best
works of art of our times transmit religious feelings urging
toward the union and the brotherhood of man (such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
are the works of Dickens, Hugo, Dostoievsky; and in
painting, of Millet, Bastien Lepage, Jules Breton,
L'Hermitte, and others); on the other hand, they strive
toward the transmission, not of feelings which are
natural to people of the upper classes only, but of such
feelings as may unite every one without exception. There
are as yet few such works, but the need of them is already
acknowledged. In recent times we also meet more and
more frequently with attempts at publications, pictures,
concerts, and theaters for the people. All this is still
very far from accomplishing what should be done, but
already the direction in which good art instinctively
presses forward to regain the path natural to it can be
discerned.</p>

<p>The religious perception of our time&mdash;which consists
in acknowledging that the aim of life (both collective
and individual) is the union of mankind&mdash;is already so
sufficiently distinct that people have now only to reject
the false theory of beauty, according to which enjoyment
is considered to be the purpose of art, and religious perception
will naturally take its place as the guide of the
art of our time.</p>

<p>And as soon as the religious perception, which already
unconsciously directs the life of man, is consciously acknowledged,
then immediately and naturally the division
of art, into art for the lower and art for the upper classes,
will disappear. There will be one common, brotherly,
universal art; and first, that art will naturally be rejected
which transmits feelings incompatible with the religious
perception of our time,&mdash;feelings which do not unite,
but divide men,&mdash;and then that insignificant, exclusive
art will be rejected to which an importance is now attached
to which it has no right.</p>

<p>And as soon as this occurs, art will immediately cease
to be what it has been in recent times,&mdash;a means of
making people coarser and more vicious; and it will
become, what it always used to be and should be, a
means by which humanity progresses toward unity and
blessedness.</p>

<p>Strange as the comparison may sound, what has happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
to the art of our circle and time is what happens
to a woman who sells her womanly attractiveness,
intended for maternity, for the pleasure of those who
desire such pleasures.</p>

<p>The art of our time and of our circle has become a
prostitute. And this comparison holds good even in
minute details. Like her it is not limited to certain
times, like her it is always adorned, like her it is always
salable, and like her it is enticing and ruinous.</p>

<p>A real work of art can only arise in the soul of an
artist occasionally as the fruit of the life he has lived,
just as a child is conceived by its mother. But counterfeit
art is produced by artisans and handicraftsmen continually,
if only consumers can be found.</p>

<p>Real art, like the wife of an affectionate husband,
needs no ornaments. But counterfeit art, like a prostitute,
must always be decked out.</p>

<p>The cause of the production of real art is the artist's
inner need to express a feeling that has accumulated, just
as for a mother the cause of sexual conception is love.
The cause of counterfeit art, as of prostitution, is gain.</p>

<p>The consequence of true art is the introduction of a new
feeling into the intercourse of life, as the consequence
of a wife's love is the birth of a new man into life.</p>

<p>The consequences of counterfeit art are the perversion
of man, pleasure which never satisfies, and the weakening
of man's spiritual strength.</p>

<p>And this is what people of our day and of our circle
should understand, in order to avoid the filthy torrent of
depraved and prostituted art with which we are deluged.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>


<p>People talk of the art of the future, meaning by "art
of the future" some especially refined, new art, which,
as they imagine, will be developed out of that exclusive
art of one class which is now considered the highest art.
But no such new art of the future can or will be found.
Our exclusive art, that of the upper classes of Christendom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
has found its way into a blind alley. The direction
in which it has been going leads nowhere. Having once
let go of that which is most essential for art (namely, the
guidance given by religious perception), that art has become
ever more and more exclusive, and therefore ever
more and more perverted, until, finally, it has come to
nothing. The art of the future, that which is really coming,
will not be a development of present-day art, but
will arise on completely other and new foundations, having
nothing in common with those by which our present
art of the upper classes is guided.</p>

<p>Art of the future, that is to say, such part of art as
will be chosen from among all the art diffused among
mankind, will consist, not in transmitting feelings accessible
only to members of the rich classes, as is the case
to-day, but in transmitting such feelings as embody the
highest religious perception of our times. Only those
productions will be considered art which transmit feelings
drawing men together in brotherly union, or such
universal feelings as can unite all men. Only such art
will be chosen, tolerated, approved, and diffused. But
art transmitting feelings flowing from antiquated, worn-out
religious teaching,&mdash;Church art, patriotic art, voluptuous
art, transmitting feelings of superstitious fear, of
pride, of vanity, of ecstatic admiration of national heroes,&mdash;art
exciting exclusive love of one's own people, or
sensuality, will be considered bad, harmful art, and will
be censured and despised by public opinion. All the
rest of art, transmitting feelings accessible only to a section
of people, will be considered unimportant, and will
be neither blamed nor praised. And the appraisement
of art in general will devolve, not, as is now the case, on
a separate class of rich people, but on the whole people;
so that for a work to be esteemed good, and to be approved
of and diffused, it will have to satisfy the demands,
not of a few people living in identical and often unnatural
conditions, but it will have to satisfy the demands
of all those great masses of people who are situated in
the natural conditions of laborious life.</p>

<p>And the artists producing art will also not be, as now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
merely a few people selected from a small section of the
nation, members of the upper classes or their hangers-on,
but will consist of all those gifted members of the
whole people who prove capable of, and are inclined
toward, artistic activity.</p>

<p>Artistic activity will then be accessible to all men. It
will become accessible to the whole people, because, in
the first place, in the art of the future, not only will that
complex technique, which deforms the productions of the
art of to-day and requires so great an effort and expenditure
of time, not be demanded, but, on the contrary, the
demand will be for clearness, simplicity, and brevity&mdash;conditions
mastered, not by mechanical exercises, but by
the education of taste. And secondly, artistic activity
will become accessible to all men of the people because,
instead of the present professional schools which only
some can enter, all will learn music and depictive art
(singing and drawing) equally with letters in the elementary
schools, and in such a way that every man, having
received the first principles of drawing and music, and
feeling a capacity for, and a call to, one or other of the
arts, will be able to perfect himself in it.</p>

<p>People think that if there are no special art schools
the technique of art will deteriorate. Undoubtedly, if
by technique we understand those complications of art
which are now considered an excellence, it will deteriorate;
but if by technique is understood clearness, beauty,
simplicity, and compression in works of art, then, even
if the elements of drawing and music were not to be
taught in the national schools, the technique will not
only not deteriorate, but, as is shown by all peasant art,
will be a hundred times better. It will be improved, because
all the artists of genius now hidden among the
masses will become producers of art and will give models
of excellence, which (as has always been the case) will
be the best schools of technique for their successors.
For every true artist, even now, learns his technique,
chiefly, not in the schools, but in life, from the examples
of the great masters; then&mdash;when the producers of art
will be the best artists of the whole nation, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
will be more such examples, and they will be more accessible&mdash;such
part of the school training as the future
artist will lose will be a hundredfold compensated for by
the training he will receive from the numerous examples
of good art diffused in society.</p>

<p>Such will be one difference between present and future
art. Another difference will be that art will not be
produced by professional artists receiving payment for
their work and engaged on nothing else besides their
art. The art of the future will be produced by all the
members of the community who feel the need of such
activity, but they will occupy themselves with art only
when they feel such need.</p>

<p>In our society people think that an artist will work
better, and produce more, if he has a secured maintenance.
And this opinion would serve once more to show
clearly, were such demonstration still needed, that what
among us is considered art is not art, but only its counterfeit.
It is quite true that for the production of boots or
loaves division of labor is very advantageous, and that
the bootmaker or baker who need not prepare his own
dinner or fetch his own fuel will make more boots or
loaves than if he had to busy himself about these matters.
But art is not a handicraft; it is the transmission
of feeling the artist has experienced. And sound feeling
can only be engendered in a man when he is living
on all its sides the life natural and proper to mankind.
And therefore security of maintenance is a condition
most harmful to an artist's true productiveness, since it
removes him from the condition natural to all men,&mdash;that
of struggle with nature for the maintenance of both
his own life and that of others,&mdash;and thus deprives him
of opportunity and possibility to experience the most
important and natural feelings of man. There is no
position more injurious to an artist's productiveness than
that position of complete security and luxury in which
artists usually live in our society.</p>

<p>The artist of the future will live the common life of
man, earning his subsistence by some kind of labor.
The fruits of that highest spiritual strength which passes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
through him he will try to share with the greatest possible
number of people, for in such transmission to others
of the feelings that have arisen in him he will find his
happiness and his reward. The artist of the future will
be unable to understand how an artist, whose chief delight
is in the wide diffusion of his works, could give
them only in exchange for a certain payment.</p>

<p>Until the dealers are driven out, the temple of art will
not be a temple. But the art of the future will drive
them out.</p>

<p>And therefore the subject-matter of the art of the
future, as I imagine it to myself, will be totally unlike
that of to-day. It will consist, not in the expression of
exclusive feelings: pride, spleen, satiety, and all possible
forms of voluptuousness, available and interesting only
to people who, by force, have freed themselves from the
labor natural to human beings; but it will consist in the
expression of feelings experienced by a man living
the life natural to all men and flowing from the religious
perception of our times, or of such feelings as are open
to all men without exception.</p>

<p>To people of our circle who do not know and cannot
or will not understand the feelings which will form the
subject-matter of the art of the future, such subject-matter
appears very poor in comparison with those subtleties
of exclusive art with which they are now occupied.
"What is there fresh to be said in the sphere of the
Christian feeling of love of one's fellow-man? The feelings
common to every one are so insignificant and monotonous,"
think they. And yet, in our time, the really
fresh feelings can only be religious, Christian feelings,
and such as are open, accessible, to all. The feelings
flowing from the religious perception of our times, Christian
feelings, are infinitely new and varied, only not in
the sense some people imagine,&mdash;not that they can be
evoked by the depiction of Christ and of gospel episodes,
or by repeating in new forms the Christian truths of
unity, brotherhood, equality, and love,&mdash;but in that all
the oldest, commonest, and most hackneyed phenomena
of life evoke the newest, most unexpected, and touching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
emotions as soon as a man regards them from the Christian
point of view.</p>

<p>What can be older than the relations between married
couples, of parents to children, of children to parents;
the relations of men to their fellow-countrymen and to
foreigners, to an invasion, to defense, to property, to
the land, or to animals? But as soon as a man regards
these matters from the Christian point of view, endlessly
varied, fresh, complex, and strong emotions immediately
arise.</p>

<p>And, in the same way, that realm of subject-matter
for the art of the future which relates to the simplest
feelings of common life open to all will not be narrowed,
but widened. In our former art only the expression of
feelings natural to people of a certain exceptional position
was considered worthy of being transmitted by art,
and even then only on condition that these feelings were
transmitted in a most refined manner, incomprehensible
to the majority of men; all the immense realm of folk-art,
and children's art&mdash;jests, proverbs, riddles, songs,
dances, children's games, and mimicry&mdash;was not esteemed
a domain worthy of art.</p>

<p>The artist of the future will understand that to compose
a fairy-tale, a little song which will touch, a lullaby
or a riddle which will entertain, a jest which will
amuse, or to draw a sketch which will delight dozens
of generations or millions of children and adults, is
incomparably more important and more fruitful than
to compose a novel or a symphony, or paint a picture
which will divert some members of the wealthy classes
for a short time, and then be forever forgotten. The
region of this art of the simple feelings accessible to
all is enormous, and it is as yet almost untouched.</p>

<p>The art of the future, therefore, will not be poorer,
but infinitely richer in subject-matter. And the form
of the art of the future will also not be inferior to the
present forms of art, but infinitely superior to them.
Superior, not in the sense of having a refined and
complex technique, but in the sense of the capacity
briefly, simply, and clearly to transmit, without any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
superfluities, the feeling which the artist has experienced
and wishes to transmit.</p>

<p>I remember once speaking to a famous astronomer
who had given public lectures on the spectrum analysis
of the stars of the Milky Way, and saying it would
be a good thing if, with his knowledge and masterly
delivery, he would give a lecture merely on the formation
and movements of the earth, for certainly there
were many people at his lecture on the spectrum
analysis of the stars of the Milky Way, especially
among the women, who did not well know why night
follows day and summer follows winter. The wise
astronomer smiled as he answered, "Yes, it would be a
good thing, but it would be very difficult. To lecture on
the spectrum analysis of the Milky Way is far easier."</p>

<p>And so it is in art. To write a rhymed poem dealing
with the times of Cleopatra, or paint a picture of
Nero burning Rome, or compose a symphony in the
manner of Brahms or Richard Strauss, or an opera
like Wagner's, is far easier than to tell a simple story
without any unnecessary details, yet so that it should
transmit the feelings of the narrator, or to draw a
pencil-sketch which should touch or amuse the beholder,
or to compose four bars of clear and simple
melody, without any accompaniment, which should
convey an impression and be remembered by those
who hear it.</p>

<p>"It is impossible for us, with our culture, to return
to a primitive state," say the artists of our time. "It
is impossible for us now to write such stories as that
of Joseph or the 'Odyssey,' to produce such statues as
the Venus of Milo, or to compose such music as the
folk-songs."</p>

<p>And indeed, for the artists of our society and day,
it is impossible, but not for the future artist, who will
be free from all the perversion of technical improvements
hiding the absence of subject-matter, and who,
not being a professional artist and receiving no payment
for his activity, will only produce art when he
feels impelled to do so by an irresistible inner impulse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span></p>

<p>The art of the future will thus be completely distinct,
both in subject-matter and in form, from what
is now called art. The only subject-matter of the art
of the future will be either feelings drawing men
toward union, or such as already unite them; and the
forms of art will be such as will be open to every
one. And therefore, the ideal of excellence in the
future will not be the exclusiveness of feeling, accessible
only to some, but, on the contrary, its universality.
And not bulkiness, obscurity, and complexity of form,
as is now esteemed, but, on the contrary, brevity,
clearness, and simplicity of expression. Only when
art has attained to that, will art neither divert nor deprave
men as it does now, calling on them to expend
their best strength on it, but be what it should be,&mdash;a
vehicle wherewith to transmit religious, Christian
perception from the realm of reason and intellect into
that of feeling, and really drawing people in actual
life nearer to that perfection and unity indicated to
them by their religious perception.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>THE CONCLUSION</h3>


<p>I have accomplished, to the best of my ability, this
work which has occupied me for fifteen years, on a subject
near to me&mdash;that of art. By saying that this subject
has occupied me for fifteen years, I do not mean that
I have been writing this book fifteen years, but only
that I began to write on art fifteen years ago, thinking
that when once I undertook the task I should be able
to accomplish it without a break. It proved, however,
that my views on the matter then were so far from clear
that I could not arrange them in a way that satisfied
me. From that time I have never ceased to think on
the subject, and I have recommenced to write on it six
or seven times; but each time, after writing a considerable
part of it, I have found myself unable to bring the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
work to a satisfactory conclusion, and have had to put
it aside. Now I have finished it; and however badly
I may have performed the task, my hope is that my
fundamental thought as to the false direction the art
of our society has taken and is following, as to the
reasons of this, and as to the real destination of art, is
correct, and that therefore my work will not be without
avail. But that this should come to pass, and that art
should really abandon its false path and take the new
direction, it is necessary that another equally important
human spiritual activity,&mdash;science,&mdash;in intimate dependence
on which art always rests, should abandon the
false path which it too, like art, is following.</p>

<p>Science and art are as closely bound together as the
lungs and the heart, so that if one organ is vitiated the
other cannot act rightly.</p>

<p>True science investigates and brings to human perception
such truths and such knowledge as the people
of a given time and society consider most important.
Art transmits these truths from the region of perception
to the region of emotion. Therefore, if the path chosen
by science be false, so also will be the path taken by art.
Science and art are like a certain kind of barge with
kedge-anchors which used to ply on our rivers. Science,
like the boats which took the anchors up-stream and made
them secure, gives direction to the forward movement;
while art, like the windlass worked on the barge to draw
it toward the anchor, causes the actual progression.
And thus a false activity of science inevitably causes a
correspondingly false activity of art.</p>

<p>As art in general is the transmission of every kind of
feeling, but in the limited sense of the word we only call
that art which transmits feelings acknowledged by us to
be important, so also science in general is the transmission
of all possible knowledge; but in the limited
sense of the word we call science that which transmits
knowledge acknowledged by us to be important.</p>

<p>And the degree of importance, both of the feelings
transmitted by art and of the information transmitted by
science, is decided by the religious perception of the given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
time and society, <i>i.e.</i> by the common understanding of
the purpose of their lives possessed by the people of
that time or society.</p>

<p>That which most of all contributes to the fulfilment
of that purpose will be studied most; that which contributes
less will be studied less; that which does not
contribute at all to the fulfilment of the purpose of human
life will be entirely neglected, or, if studied, such
study will not be accounted science. So it always has
been, and so it should be now; for such is the nature of
human knowledge and of human life. But the science
of the upper classes of our time, which not only does
not acknowledge any religion, but considers every religion
to be mere superstition, could not and cannot make
such distinctions.</p>

<p>Scientists of our day affirm that they study <i>everything</i>
impartially; but as everything is too much (is in fact an
infinite number of objects), and as it is impossible to
study all alike, this is only said in the theory, while in
practice not everything is studied, and study is applied
far from impartially, only that being studied which, on
the one hand, is most wanted by, and on the other hand,
is pleasantest to, those people who occupy themselves
with science. And what the people, belonging to the
upper classes, who are occupying themselves with science
most want is the maintenance of the system under which
those classes retain their privileges; and what is pleasantest
are such things as satisfy idle curiosity, do not demand
great mental efforts, and can be practically applied.</p>

<p>And therefore one side of science, including theology
and philosophy adapted to the existing order, as also
history and political economy of the same sort, are
chiefly occupied in proving that the existing order is
the very one which ought to exist; that it has come into
existence and continues to exist by the operation of immutable
laws not amenable to human will, and that all
efforts to change it are therefore harmful and wrong.
The other part, experimental science,&mdash;including mathematics,
astronomy, chemistry, physics, botany, and all
the natural sciences,&mdash;is exclusively occupied with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
things that have no direct relation to human life: with
what is curious, and with things of which practical application
advantageous to people of the upper classes
can be made. And to justify that selection of objects
of study which (in conformity to their own position) the
men of science of our times have made, they have devised
a theory of science for science's sake, quite similar
to the theory of art for art's sake.</p>

<p>As by the theory of art for art's sake it appears that
occupation with all those things that please us&mdash;is art,
so, by the theory of science for science's sake, the study
of that which interests us&mdash;is science.</p>

<p>So that one side of science, instead of studying how
people should live in order to fulfil their mission in life,
demonstrates the righteousness and immutability of the
bad and false arrangements of life which exist around
us; while the other part, experimental science, occupies
itself with questions of simple curiosity or with
technical improvements.</p>

<p>The first of these divisions of science is harmful, not
only because it confuses people's perceptions and gives
false decisions, but also because it exists, and occupies
the ground which should belong to true science. It
does this harm, that each man, in order to approach the
study of the most important questions of life, must first
refute these erections of lies which have during ages
been piled around each of the most essential questions
of human life, and which are propped up by all the
strength of human ingenuity.</p>

<p>The second division&mdash;the one of which modern science
is so particularly proud, and which is considered
by many people to be the only real science&mdash;is harmful
in that it diverts attention from the really important
subjects to insignificant subjects, and is also directly
harmful in that, under the evil system of society which
the first division of science justifies and supports, a great
part of the technical gains of science are turned, not to
the advantage, but to the injury of mankind.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is only to those who are devoting their lives
to such study that it seems as if all the inventions which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
are made in the sphere of natural science were very
important and useful things. And to these people it
seems so only when they do not look around them and
do not see what is really important. They only need
tear themselves away from the psychological microscope
under which they examine the objects of their
study, and look about them, in order to see how insignificant
is all that has afforded them such naïve pride,
all that knowledge not only of geometry of <i>n</i>-dimensions,
spectrum analysis of the Milky Way, the form of atoms,
dimensions of human skulls of the Stone Age, and similar
trifles, but even our knowledge of micro-organisms,
X-rays, etc., in comparison with such knowledge as we
have thrown aside and handed over to the perversions
of the professors of theology, jurisprudence, political
economy, financial science, etc. We need only look
around us to perceive that the activity proper to real
science is not the study of whatever happens to interest
us, but the study of how man's life should be established,&mdash;the
study of those questions of religion, morality, and
social life, without the solution of which all our knowledge
of nature will be harmful or insignificant.</p>

<p>We are highly delighted and very proud that our
science renders it possible to utilize the energy of a
waterfall and make it work in factories, or that we have
pierced tunnels through mountains, and so forth. But
the pity of it is that we make the force of the waterfall
labor, not for the benefit of the workmen, but to enrich
capitalists who produce articles of luxury or weapons
of man-destroying war. The same dynamite with which
we blast the mountains to pierce tunnels we use for
wars, from which latter we not only do not intend to
abstain, but which we consider inevitable, and for which
we unceasingly prepare.</p>

<p>If we are now able to inoculate preventatively with
diphtheritic microbes, to find a needle in a body by
means of X-rays, to straighten a hunched-back, cure
syphilis, and perform wonderful operations, we should
not be proud of these acquisitions either (even were
they all established beyond dispute) if we fully understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
the true purpose of real science. If but one-tenth
of the efforts now spent on objects of pure curiosity or
of merely practical application were expended on real
science organizing the life of man, more than half the
people now sick would not have the illnesses from which
a small minority of them now get cured in hospitals.
There would be no poor-blooded and deformed children
growing up in factories, no death-rates, as now, of fifty
per cent among children, no deterioration of whole generations,
no prostitution, no syphilis, and no murdering
of hundreds of thousands in wars, nor those horrors of
folly and of misery which our present science considers
a necessary condition of human life.</p>

<p>We have so perverted the conception of science that
it seems strange to men of our day to allude to sciences
which should prevent the mortality of children, prostitution,
syphilis, the deterioration of whole generations, and
the wholesale murder of men. It seems to us that
science is only then real science when a man in a laboratory
pours liquids from one jar into another, or analyzes
the spectrum, or cuts up frogs and porpoises, or weaves
in a specialized, scientific jargon an obscure network
of conventional phrases&mdash;theological, philosophical, historical,
juridical, or politico-economical&mdash;semi-intelligible
to the man himself, and intended to demonstrate that
what now is, is what should be.</p>

<p>But science, true science,&mdash;such science as would
really deserve the respect which is now claimed by the
followers of one (the least important) part of science,&mdash;is
not at all such as this: real science lies in knowing
what we should and what we should not believe, in
knowing how the associated life of man should and
should not be constituted; how to treat sexual relations,
how to educate children, how to use the land, how to
cultivate it oneself without oppressing other people, how
to treat foreigners, how to treat animals, and much more
that is important for the life of man.</p>

<p>Such has true science ever been and such it should be.
And such science is springing up in our times; but, on
the one hand, such true science is denied and refuted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
all those scientific people who defend the existing order
of society, and, on the other hand, it is considered
empty, unnecessary, unscientific science by those who
are engrossed in experimental science.</p>

<p>For instance, books and sermons appear, demonstrating
the antiquatedness and absurdity of Church dogmas,
as well as the necessity of establishing a reasonable
religious perception suitable to our times, and all the
theology that is considered to be real science is only
engaged in refuting these works and in exercising human
intelligence again and again to find support and justification
for superstitions long since outlived, and which
have now become quite meaningless. Or a sermon
appears showing that land should not be an object of
private possession, and that the institution of private
property in land is a chief cause of the poverty of the
masses. Apparently science, real science, should welcome
such a sermon and draw further deductions from
this position. But the science of our times does nothing
of the kind: on the contrary, political economy demonstrates
the opposite position; namely, that landed property,
like every other form of property, must be more
and more concentrated in the hands of a small number
of owners. Again, in the same way, one would suppose
it to be the business of real science to demonstrate the
irrationality, unprofitableness, and immorality of war and
of executions; or the inhumanity and harmfulness of
prostitution; or the absurdity, harmfulness, and immorality
of using narcotics or of eating animals; or the
irrationality, harmfulness, and antiquatedness of patriotism.
And such works exist, but are all considered
unscientific; while works to prove that all these things
ought to continue, and works intended to satisfy an idle
thirst for knowledge lacking any relation to human life,
are considered to be scientific.</p>

<p>The deviation of the science of our time from its
true purpose is strikingly illustrated by those ideals
which are put forward by some scientists, and are not
denied, but admitted, by the majority of scientific men.</p>

<p>These ideals are expressed not only in stupid, fashionable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
books, describing the world as it will be in 1000
or 3000 years' time, but also by sociologists who
consider themselves serious men of science. These
ideals are that food, instead of being obtained from the
land by agriculture, will be prepared in laboratories
by chemical means, and that human labor will be almost
entirely superseded by the utilization of natural forces.</p>

<p>Man will not, as now, eat an egg laid by a hen he has
kept, or bread grown on his field, or an apple from
a tree he has reared and which has blossomed and
matured in his sight; but he will eat tasty, nutritious,
food which will be prepared in laboratories by the conjoint
labor of many people in which he will take a small
part. Man will hardly need to labor, so that all men
will be able to yield to idleness as the upper, ruling
classes now yield to it.</p>

<p>Nothing shows more plainly than these ideals to what
a degree the science of our times has deviated from the
true path.</p>

<p>The great majority of men in our times lack good and
sufficient food (as well as dwellings and clothes and all
the first necessaries of life). And this great majority
of men is compelled, to the injury of its well-being, to
labor continually beyond its strength. Both these evils
can easily be removed by abolishing mutual strife,
luxury, and the unrighteous distribution of wealth, in a
word, by the abolition of a false and harmful order and
the establishment of a reasonable, human manner of
life. But science considers the existing order of things
to be as immutable as the movements of the planets,
and therefore assumes that the purpose of science is&mdash;not
to elucidate the falseness of this order and to arrange
a new, reasonable way of life&mdash;but, under the existing
order of things, to feed everybody and enable all to
be as idle as the ruling classes, who live a depraved
life, now are.</p>

<p>And, meanwhile, it is forgotten that nourishment with
corn, vegetables, and fruit raised from the soil by one's
own labor is the pleasantest, healthiest, easiest, and most
natural nourishment, and that the work of using one's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
muscles is as necessary a condition of life as is the
oxidation of the blood by breathing.</p>

<p>To invent means whereby people might, while continuing
our false division of property and labor, be well
nourished by means of chemically prepared food, and
might make the forces of nature work for them, is like
inventing means to pump oxygen into the lungs of
a man kept in a closed chamber, the air of which is bad,
when all that is needed is to cease to confine the man
in the closed chamber.</p>

<p>In the vegetable and animal kingdoms a laboratory
for the production of food has been arranged, such as
can be surpassed by no professors, and to enjoy the
fruits of this laboratory, and to participate in it, man
has only to yield to that ever joyful impulse to labor,
without which man's life is a torment. And lo and
behold! the scientists of our times, instead of employing
all their strength to abolish whatever hinders man
from utilizing the good things prepared for him, acknowledge
the conditions under which man is deprived
of these blessings to be unalterable, and instead of
arranging the life of man so that he might work joyfully
and be fed from the soil, they devise methods which will
cause him to become an artificial abortion. It is like
not helping a man out of confinement into the fresh air,
but devising means, instead, to pump into him the necessary
quantity of oxygen and arranging so that he may
live in a stifling cellar instead of living at home.</p>

<p>Such false ideals could not exist if science were not
on a false path.</p>

<p>And yet the feelings transmitted by art grow up on
the bases supplied by science.</p>

<p>But what feelings can such misdirected science evoke?
One side of this science evokes antiquated feelings,
which humanity has used up, and which, in our times,
are bad and exclusive. The other side, occupied with
the study of subjects unrelated to the conduct of human
life, by its very nature cannot serve as a basis for art.</p>

<p>So that art in our times, to be art, must either open
up its own road independently of science, or must take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
direction from the unrecognized science which is denounced
by the orthodox section of science. And this
is what art, when it even partially fulfils its mission, is
doing.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that the work I have tried to perform
concerning art will be performed also for science&mdash;that
the falseness of the theory of science for science's sake
will be demonstrated; that the necessity of acknowledging
Christian teaching in its true meaning will be
clearly shown, that on the basis of that teaching a reappraisement
will be made of the knowledge we possess,
and of which we are so proud; that the secondariness
and insignificance of experimental science, and the
primacy and importance of religious, moral, and social
knowledge will be established; and that such knowledge
will not, as now, be left to the guidance of the upper
classes only, but will form a chief interest of all free,
truth-loving men, such as those who, not in agreement
with the upper classes, but in their despite, have always
forwarded the real science of life.</p>

<p>Astronomical, physical, chemical, and biological science,
as also technical and medical science, will be
studied only in so far as they can help to free mankind
from religious, juridical, or social deceptions, or can
serve to promote the well-being of all men, and not of
any single class.</p>

<p>Only then will science cease to be what it is now,&mdash;on
the one hand a system of sophistries, needed for the
maintenance of the existing worn-out order of society,
and, on the other hand, a shapeless mass of miscellaneous
knowledge, for the most part good for little or
nothing,&mdash;and become a shapely and organic whole,
having a definite and reasonable purpose comprehensible
to all men; namely, the purpose of bringing to the
consciousness of men the truths that flow from the religious
perception of our times.</p>

<p>And only then will art, which is always dependent on
science, be what it might and should be, an organ co-equally
important with science for the life and progress
of mankind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span></p>

<p>Art is not a pleasure, a solace, or an amusement; art
is a great matter. Art is an organ of human life, transmitting
man's reasonable perception into feeling. In
our age the common religious perception of men is the
consciousness of the brotherhood of man&mdash;we know
that the well-being of man lies in union with his fellow-men.
True science should indicate the various methods
of applying this consciousness to life. Art should transform
this perception into feeling.</p>

<p>The task of art is enormous. Through the influence
of real art, aided by science guided by religion, that
peaceful coöperation of man which is now obtained by
external means&mdash;by our law-courts, police, charitable
institutions, factory inspection, etc.&mdash;should be obtained
by man's free and joyous activity. Art should cause
violence to be set aside.</p>

<p>And it is only art that can accomplish this.</p>

<p>All that now, independently of the fear of violence
and punishment, makes the social life of man possible
(and already now this is an enormous part of the order
of our lives)&mdash;all this has been brought about by art.
If by art it has been inculcated how people should treat
religious objects, their parents, their children, their wives,
their relations, strangers, foreigners; how to conduct
themselves to their elders, their superiors, to those who
suffer, to their enemies, and to animals; and if this has
been obeyed through generations by millions of people,
not only unenforced by any violence, but so that the
force of such customs can be shaken in no way but by
means of art&mdash;then, by the same art, other customs,
more in accord with the religious perception of our time,
may be evoked. If art has been able to convey the
sentiment of reverence for images, for the eucharist, and
for the king's person; of shame at betraying a comrade,
devotion to a flag, the necessity of revenge for an insult,
the need to sacrifice one's labor for the erection and
adornment of churches, the duty of defending one's
honor or the glory of one's native land&mdash;then that
same art can also evoke reverence for the dignity of
every man and for the life of every animal; can make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
men ashamed of luxury, of violence, of revenge, or of
using for their pleasure that of which others are in need;
can compel people freely, gladly, and without noticing it,
to sacrifice themselves in the service of man.</p>

<p>The task for art to accomplish is to make that feeling
of brotherhood and love of one's neighbor, now
attained only by the best members of society, the
customary feeling and the instinct of all men. By
evoking, under imaginary conditions, the feeling of
brotherhood and love, religious art will train men to experience
those same feelings under similar circumstances
in actual life; it will lay in the souls of men the rails
along which the actions of those whom art thus educates
will naturally pass. And universal art, by uniting the
most different people in one common feeling, by destroying
separation, will educate people to union, will show
them, not by reason, but by life itself, the joy of universal
union reaching beyond the bounds set by life.</p>

<p>The destiny of art in our time is to transmit from the
realm of reason to the realm of feeling the truth that
well-being for men consists in being united together, and
to set up, in place of the existing reign of force, that
kingdom of God, <i>i.e.</i> of love, which we all recognize to
be the highest aim of human life.</p>

<p>Possibly, in the future, science may reveal to art yet
newer and higher ideals, which art may realize; but, in
our time, the destiny of art is clear and definite. The
task for Christian art is to establish brotherly union
among men.</p>

<p>This is the first page of Mallarmé's book, "Divagations":&mdash;</p>

<p class="center space-above">LE PHÉNOMÈNE FUTUR</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Un ciel pâle, sur le monde qui finit de décrépitude, va peut-être
partir avec les nuages: les lambeaux de la pourpre usée
des couchants déteignent dans une rivière dormant à&nbsp;l'horizon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
submergé de rayons et d'eau. Les arbres s'ennuient, et, sous
leur feuillage blanchi (de la poussière du temps plutôt que
celle des chemins) monte la maison en toile de Montreur de
choses Passées: maint réverbère attend le crépuscule et ravive
les visages d'une malheureuse foule, vaincue par la maladie immortelle
et le péché des siècles, d'hommes près de leurs chétives
complices enceintes des fruits misérables avec lesquels périra
la terre. Dans le silence inquiet de tous les yeux suppliant là-bas
le soleil qui, sous l'eau, s'enfonce avec le désespoir d'un cri,
voici le simple boniment: "Nulle enseigne ne vous régale du
spectacle intérieur, car il n'est pas maintenant un peintre capable
d'en donner une ombre triste. J'apporte, vivante (et préservée
à travers les ans par la science souveraine) une Femme
d'autrefois. Quelque folie, originelle et naïve, une extase d'or,
je ne sais quoi! par elle nommé sa chevelure, se ploie avec la
grâce des étoffes autour d'un visage qu' éclaire la nudité sanglante
de ses lèvres. A la place du vêtement vain, elle a un
corps; et les yeux, semblables aux pierres rares! ne valent pas
ce regard qui sort de sa chair heureuse: des seins levés comme
s'ils étaient pleins d'un lait éternel, la pointe vers le ciel, les
jambes lisses qui gardent le sel de la mer première." Se rappelant
leurs pauvres épouses, chauves, morbides et pleines
d'horreur, les maris se pressent: elles aussi par curiosité, mélancoliques,
veulent voir.</p>

<p>Quand tous auront contemplé la noble créature, vestige de
quelque époque déjà&nbsp;maudite, les uns indifférents, car ils n'auront
pas eu la force de comprendre, mais d'autres navrés et la
paupière humide de larmes résignées, se regarderont; tandis
que les poètes de ces temps, sentant se rallumer leur yeux
éteints, s'achemineront vers leur lampe, le cerveau ivre un instant
d'une gloire confuse, hantés du Rythme et dans l'oubli
d'exister à&nbsp;une époque qui survit à&nbsp;la beauté.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center space-above">THE FUTURE PHENOMENON&mdash;<span class="smcap">by Mallarmé</span>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A pale sky, above the world that is ending through decrepitude,
going, perhaps, to pass away with the clouds: shreds of worn-out
purple of the sunsets wash off their color in a river sleeping on the
horizon, submerged with rays and water. The trees are weary and,
beneath their foliage, whitened (by the dust of time rather than that
of the roads), rises the canvas house of "Showman of things Past."
Many a lamp awaits the gloaming, and brightens the faces of a
miserable crowd vanquished by the immortal illness and the sin of
ages, of men by the sides of their puny accomplices pregnant with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
the miserable fruit with which the world will perish. In the anxious
silence of all the eyes supplicating the sun there, which sinks under
the water with the desperation of a cry, this is the plain announcement:
"No sign-board now regales you with the spectacle that is
inside, for there is no painter now capable of giving even a shadow
of it. I bring living (and preserved by sovereign science through
the years) a Woman of other days. Some kind of folly, naïve and
original, an ecstasy of gold, I know not what, by her called her hair,
clings with the grace of some material round a face brightened by
the blood-red nudity of her lips. In place of vain clothing, she has
a body; and her eyes, resembling precious stones! are not worth
that look, which comes from her happy flesh: breasts raised as if
full of eternal milk, the points toward the sky; the smooth legs, that
keep the salt of the first sea." Remembering their poor spouses,
bald, morbid, and full of horrors, the husbands press forward: the
women, too, from curiosity, gloomily wish to see.</p>

<p>When all shall have contemplated the noble creature, vestige of
some epoch already damned, some indifferently, for they will not
have had strength to understand, but others, broken-hearted, and
with eyelids wet with tears of resignation, will look at each other;
while the poets of those times, feeling their dim eyes rekindled, will
make their way toward their lamp, their brain for an instant drunk
with confused glory, haunted by Rhythm, and forgetful that they
exist at an epoch which has survived beauty.</p></blockquote>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">Enone, in loving thy beauty, I thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the soul and the body to union are brought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That mounting by steadying my heart and my mind,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And mingling sounds different from the nerves of his lyre,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But, alas! my courage, so faint and nigh spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dart that has struck me proves without fail<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No, 'twas that other Venus that caused me to smart,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yet oh, Enone mine, a God's that Cupid still.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Humility grand, words of virtue and grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I looked yestere'en in the pond frozen fast,<br /></span>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_III" id="APPENDIX_III">APPENDIX III</a></h2>


<p>These are the contents of "The Nibelung's Ring":&mdash;</p>

<p>The first part tells that the nymphs, the daughters of
the Rhine, for some reason guard gold in the Rhine,
and sing: Weia, Waga, Woge du Welle, Walle zur
Wiege, Wagala-weia, Wallala, Weiala, Weia, and so
forth.</p>

<p>These singing nymphs are pursued by a gnome (a
nibelung) who desires to seize them. The gnome cannot
catch any of them. Then the nymphs guarding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
the gold tell the gnome just what they ought to keep
secret, namely, that whoever renounces love will be
able to steal the gold they are guarding. And the
gnome renounces love, and steals the gold. This
ends the first scene.</p>

<p>In the second scene a god and a goddess lie in a
field in sight of a castle which giants have built for
them. Presently they wake up and are pleased with
the castle, and they relate that in payment for this
work they must give the goddess Freia to the giants.
The giants come for their pay. But the god Wotan
objects to parting with Freia. The giants get angry.
The gods hear that the gnome has stolen the gold,
promise to confiscate it, and to pay the giants with it.
But the giants won't trust them, and seize the goddess
Freia in pledge.</p>

<p>The third scene takes place underground. The
gnome Alberich, who stole the gold, for some reason
beats a gnome, Mime, and takes from him a helmet
which has the power both of making people invisible
and of turning them into other animals. The gods,
Wotan and others, appear and quarrel with one another
and with the gnomes, and wish to take the gold,
but Alberich won't give it up, and (like everybody
all through the piece) behaves in a way to insure his
own ruin. He puts on the helmet, and becomes first
a dragon and then a toad. The gods catch the toad,
take the helmet off it, and carry Alberich away with
them.</p>

<p>Scene IV. The gods bring Alberich to their home,
and order him to command his gnomes to bring them
all the gold. The gnomes bring it. Alberich gives up
the gold, but keeps a magic ring. The gods take the
ring. So Alberich curses the ring, and says it is to bring
misfortune on any one who has it. The giants appear;
they bring the goddess Freia, and demand her ransom.
They stick up staves of Freia's height, and gold is poured
in between these staves: this is to be the ransom. There
is not enough gold, so the helmet is thrown in, and they
also demand the ring. Wotan refuses to give it up, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
the goddess Erda appears and commands him to do so,
because it brings misfortune. Wotan gives it up. Freia
is released. The giants, having received the ring, fight,
and one of them kills the other. This ends the Prelude,
and we come to the First Day.</p>

<p>The scene shows a house in a tree. Siegmund runs
in tired, and lies down. Sieglinda, the mistress of the
house (and wife of Hunding), gives him a drugged
draught, and they fall in love with each other. Sieglinda's
husband comes home, learns that Siegmund belongs
to a hostile race, and wishes to fight him next
day; but Sieglinda drugs her husband, and comes to
Siegmund. Siegmund discovers that Sieglinda is his
sister, and that his father drove a sword into the tree
so that no one can get it out. Siegmund pulls the
sword out, and commits incest with his sister.</p>

<p>Act II. Siegmund is to fight with Hunding. The
gods discuss the question to whom they shall award the
victory. Wotan, approving of Siegmund's incest with
his sister, wishes to spare him, but, under pressure from
his wife, Fricka, he orders the Valkyrie Brünnhilda to
kill Siegmund. Siegmund goes to fight; Sieglinda
faints. Brünnhilda appears and wishes to slay Siegmund.
Siegmund wishes to kill Sieglinda also, but
Brünnhilda does not allow it; so he fights with Hunding.
Brünnhilda defends Siegmund, but Wotan defends
Hunding. Siegmund's sword breaks, and he is killed.
Sieglinda runs away.</p>

<p>Act III. The Valkyries (divine Amazons) are on the
stage. The Valkyrie Brünnhilda arrives on horseback,
bringing Siegmund's body. She is flying from Wotan,
who is chasing her for her disobedience. Wotan catches
her, and as a punishment dismisses her from her post
as a Valkyrie. He casts a spell on her, so that she has
to go to sleep and to continue asleep until a man wakes
her. When some one wakes her she will fall in love
with him. Wotan kisses her; she falls asleep. He
lets off fire, which surrounds her.</p>

<p>We now come to the Second Day. The gnome Mime
forges a sword in a wood. Siegfried appears. He is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
son born from the incest of brother with sister (Siegmund
with Sieglinda), and has been brought up in this
wood by the gnome. In general the motives of the
actions of everybody in this production are quite unintelligible.
Siegfried learns his own origin, and that the
broken sword was his father's. He orders Mime to
reforge it, and then goes off. Wotan comes in the
guise of a wanderer, and relates what will happen: that
he who has not learnt to fear will forge the sword, and
will defeat everybody. The gnome conjectures that
this is Siegfried, and wants to poison him. Siegfried
returns, forges his father's sword, and runs off, shouting,
Heiho! heiho! heiho! Ho! ho! Aha! oho! aha!
Heiaho! heiaho! heiaho! Ho! ho! Hahei! hoho!
hahei!</p>

<p>And we get to Act II. Alberich sits guarding a
giant, who, in form of a dragon, guards the gold he has
received. Wotan appears, and for some unknown reason
foretells that Siegfried will come and kill the dragon.
Alberich wakes the dragon, and asks him for the ring,
promising to defend him from Siegfried. The dragon
won't give up the ring. Exit Alberich. Mime and
Siegfried appear. Mime hopes the dragon will teach
Siegfried to fear. But Siegfried does not fear. He
drives Mime away and kills the dragon, after which he
puts his finger, smeared with the dragon's blood, to his
lips. This enables him to know men's secret thoughts,
as well as the language of birds. The birds tell him
where the treasure and the ring are, and also that Mime
wishes to poison him. Mime returns, and says out loud
that he wishes to poison Siegfried. This is meant to
signify that Siegfried, having tasted dragon's blood,
understands people's secret thoughts. Siegfried, having
learnt Mime's intentions, kills him. The birds tell
Siegfried where Brünnhilda is, and he goes to find her.</p>

<p>Act III. Wotan calls up Erda. Erda prophesies to
Wotan, and gives him advice. Siegfried appears,
quarrels with Wotan, and they fight. Suddenly Siegfried's
sword breaks Wotan's spear, which had been
more powerful than anything else. Siegfried goes into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
the fire to Brünnhilda: kisses her; she wakes up,
abandons her divinity, and throws herself into Siegfried's
arms.</p>

<p>Third Day. Prelude. Three Norns plait a golden
rope, and talk about the future. They go away.
Siegfried and Brünnhilda appear. Siegfried takes leave
of her, gives her the ring, and goes away.</p>

<p>Act I. By the Rhine. A king wants to get married,
and also to give his sister in marriage. Hagen, the
king's wicked brother, advises him to marry Brünnhilda
and to give his sister to Siegfried. Siegfried appears;
they give him a drugged draught, which makes him
forget all the past and fall in love with the king's sister,
Gutrune. So he rides off with Gunther, the king, to
get Brünnhilda to be the king's bride. The scene
changes. Brünnhilda sits with the ring. A Valkyrie
comes to her and tells her that Wotan's spear is broken,
and advises her to give the ring to the Rhine nymphs.
Siegfried comes, and by means of the magic helmet
turns himself into Gunther, demands the ring from
Brünnhilda, seizes it, and drags her off to sleep with
him.</p>

<p>Act II. By the Rhine. Alberich and Hagen discuss
how to get the ring. Siegfried comes, tells how he has
obtained a bride for Gunther and spent the night with
her, but put a sword between himself and her. Brünnhilda
rides up, recognizes the ring on Siegfried's hand,
and declares that it was he, and not Gunther, who was
with her. Hagen stirs everybody up against Siegfried,
and decides to kill him next day when hunting.</p>

<p>Act III. Again the nymphs in the Rhine relate what
has happened. Siegfried, who has lost his way, appears.
The nymphs ask him for the ring, but he won't
give it up. Hunters appear. Siegfried tells the story
of his life. Hagen then gives him a draught, which
causes his memory to return to him. Siegfried relates
how he aroused and obtained Brünnhilda, and every one
is astonished. Hagen stabs him in the back, and the
scene is changed. Gutrune meets the corpse of Siegfried.
Gunther and Hagen quarrel about the ring, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
Hagen kills Gunther. Brünnhilda cries. Hagen wishes
to take the ring from Siegfried's hand, but the hand
of the corpse raises itself threateningly. Brünnhilda
takes the ring from Siegfried's hand, and when Siegfried's
corpse is carried to the pyre, she gets on to a
horse and leaps into the fire. The Rhine rises, and
the waves reach the pyre. In the river are three
nymphs. Hagen throws himself into the fire to get
the ring, but the nymphs seize him and carry him off.
One of them holds the ring; and that is the end of the
matter.</p>

<p>The impression obtainable from my recapitulation is,
of course, incomplete. But however incomplete it may
be, it is certainly infinitely more favorable than the impression
which results from reading the four booklets in
which the work is printed.</p>

<p class="center">THE SOUP AND THE CLOUDS</p>

<p>My beloved little silly was giving me my dinner, and I was contemplating,
through the open window of the dining-room, those
moving architectures which God makes out of vapors, the marvelous
constructions of the impalpable. And I said to myself, amid
my contemplations, "All these phantasmagoria are almost as beautiful
as the eyes of my beautiful beloved, the monstrous little silly
with the green eyes."</p>

<p>Suddenly I felt the violent blow of a fist on my back, and I heard
a harsh, charming voice, an hysterical voice, as it were hoarse with
brandy, the voice of my dear little well-beloved, saying, "Are you
going to eat your soup soon, you d&mdash;&mdash; b&mdash;&mdash; of a dealer in clouds?"</p>


<p class="center space-above">BAUDELAIRE'S PROSE POEM</p>

<p>As the carriage was passing through the forest, he ordered it to be
stopped near a shooting-gallery, saying that he wished to shoot off
a few bullets to <i>kill</i> Time. To kill this monster, is it not the most
ordinary and the most legitimate occupation of every one? And he
gallantly offered his arm to his dear, delicious, and execrable wife&mdash;that

pain, and perhaps also a large part of his genius.</p>

<p>Several bullets struck far from the intended mark&mdash;one even
penetrated the ceiling; and as the charming creature laughed madly,
mocking her husband's awkwardness, he turned abruptly toward
her and said, "Look at that doll there on the right with the haughty
mien and her nose in the air; well, dear angel, <i>I imagine to myself
that it is you!</i>" And he closed his eyes and pulled the trigger.
The doll was neatly decapitated.</p>

<p>Then, bowing toward his dear one, his delightful, execrable wife,
his inevitable pitiless muse, and kissing her hand respectfully, he
added, "Ah! my dear angel, how I thank you for my skill!"</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> I know of but one criticism, or rather essay, for it can hardly be
termed criticism, in the strict sense of the word, which treats of the same
subject, having my book in view. It is a pamphlet by Troïtzky, called
"The Sermon on the Mount" (printed in Kazan). Evidently the author
acknowledges the doctrine of Christ in the fullness of its meaning. He
declares that the commandment of non-resistance to evil means what it
says, and the same with the commandment as to taking an oath. He does
not deny, as others have done, the meaning of Christ's teaching, but unfortunately
neither does he draw those inevitable conclusions which must
result from a conception such as his own of Christ's doctrine. If one is
not to resist evil by violence, nor to take an oath, it is but natural to ask:
Then what is the duty of a soldier? And what is to be done about taking
the oath of allegiance? But to these questions the author makes no reply,
and surely a reply should have been given. If he had none to make, it
would have been better to have said nothing at all.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> The Church is the society of the faithful, established by our Lord
Jesus Christ, diffused throughout the world, subject to the authority of its
lawful pastors and our holy father the Pope.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> The definition of Homiakov, which had a certain success among the
Russians, does not help the case, if one believes with him that the Orthodox
is the only true Church. Homiakov asserts that a church is a society
of men (without distinction between the ecclesiastics and the laity) united
by love, and to whom the truth is revealed ("Let us love one another,
that we may unanimously profess," etc.), and that such a church is, in the
first place, one that professes the Nicene creed, and, secondly, one which,
after the division of the churches, refused to recognize the authority of the
Pope and the new dogmas. With such a definition as this, the difficulty
of identifying a church which is united by love with a church professing
the Nicene creed, and the accuracy of Photius, as Homiakov would have
it, is still greater. Hence the statement of Homiakov that this church
united by love, and therefore holy, is the same as that of the Greek hierarchy,
is still more arbitrary than the assertions of the Catholics and the
old Greek Orthodox believers. If we admit the existence of the Church
according to the idea of Homiakov, that is, as a society of men united by
love and truth, then all that any man can say in regard to it, is that it
would be most desirable to be a member of that society,&mdash;if such an one
exists,&mdash;that is, to live in the spirit of love and truth; but there are no
outward manifestations by which one could either acknowledge one's self,
or recognize others as members of this holy society, or exclude one's
self from it, for there is no outward institution to be found which corresponds
to that idea.</p></div>

destroyed by the numerous and varied systems which grow out of it, such
as the existence of the family, of the nation, and of the State, and even of
that life of humanity conceived according to the theory of the Positivists.
</p>
<p>
These multifarious systems of life are based upon the fundamental idea
of the insignificance of the individual, and the assurance that the meaning
of life is to be sought and found only in humanity, taken in its broadest
sense.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Author.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> Here, for example, is a characteristic expression of opinion in the
American periodical, <i>The Arena,</i> for November, 1890, from an article
entitled "New Basis of Church Life." Discussing the significance of the
Sermon on the Mount, and especially the doctrine of non-resistance to
evil, the author, having no reason for obscuring its meaning as the ecclesiastics
do, says:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Devout common sense must gradually come to look upon Christ as a
philanthropic teacher, who, like every enthusiast who ever taught, went to
an Utopian extreme in his own philosophy. Every great agitation for the
betterment of the world has been led by men who beheld their own mission
with such absorbing intensity that they could see little else. It is no
reproach to Christ to say that he had the typical reformer's temperament;
that his precepts cannot be literally accepted as a complete philosophy of
life; and that men are to analyze them reverently, but, at the same time,
in the spirit of ordinary truth-seeking criticism," etc.
</p>
<p>
"Christ did in fact preach absolute communism and anarchy; but,"
and so on. Christ would have been glad to have expressed Himself in
more fitting terms, but He did not possess our critical faculty in the use of
exact definitions, therefore we will set Him right. All He said concerning
meekness, sacrifice, poverty, and of taking no thought for the morrow,
were but haphazard utterances, because of His ignorance of scientific
phraseology.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> That the abuse of authority exists in America, despite the small number
of troops, by no means refutes our argument; on the contrary, it
serves rather as a testimony in its favor. In America there are fewer
troops than in other States, and nowhere do we find less oppression of the
downtrodden classes, and nowhere have men come so near to the abolition
of governmental abuses, and even of government itself. However, it is in
America that, owing to the growing unity among the working-men, voices
have been heard, more and more frequently of late, calling for an increase
of troops, and this when no foreign invasion threatens the States. The
ruling classes are fully aware that an army of 50,000 men is insufficient,
and, having lost confidence in Pinkerton's forces, they believe that their
salvation can only be secured by the increase of the army.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> The fact that some nations, like the English and American, have no
general conscription system (although one hears already voices in its favor),
but a system of recruiting and hiring soldiers, nowise alters the case as
regards the slavery of the citizens under the government. In the former
system every man must go himself to kill or be killed; in the latter, he
must give the proceeds of his labor to employ and drill murderers.</p></div>

succeeds in making of an animal's corpse an object in all respects tasteful.
The principle of the Art of Taste (which goes beyond the so-called

the symbol of some Idea, and always in harmony with the Idea to be

a notion which the eye alone cannot afford, and one of considerable
æsthetic value, namely, that of <i>softness</i>, <i>silkiness</i>, <i>polish</i>. The beauty
of velvet is characterized not less by its softness to the touch than by
its luster. In the idea we form of a woman's beauty, the softness of
her skin enters as an essential element.

<p><a name="Footnote_43_43" id="Footnote_43_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43_43"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> There is no science which, more than æsthetics, has been handed over
to the reveries of the metaphysicians. From Plato down to the received
doctrines of our day, people have made of art a strange amalgam of quintessential
fancies and transcendental mysteries, which find their supreme
expression in the conception of an absolute ideal Beauty, immutable and
divine prototype of actual things.</p></div>

Betrachtungen des Plato und Aristoteles und die des Plotins
fällt, kann zwar auffällig erscheinen; dennoch kann man eigentlich nicht
sagen, dass in dieser Zwischenzeit überhaupt von ästhetischen Dingen
nicht die Rede gewesen; oder dass gar ein völliger Mangel an Zusammenhang
zwischen den Kunst-anschauungen des letztgenannten Philosophen
und denen der ersteren existire. Freilich wurde die von Aristoteles begründete
Wissenschaft in Nichts dadurch gefördert; immerhin aber zeigt
sich in jener Zwischenzeit noch ein gewisses Interesse für ästhetische
Fragen. Nach Plotin aber, die wenigen, ihm in der Zeit nahestehenden
Philosophen, wie Longin, Augustin, u. s. f. kommen, wie wir gesehen, kaum
in Betracht und schliessen sich übrigens in ihrer Anschauungsweise an
ihn an,&mdash;vergehen nicht fünf, sondern <i>fünfzehn Jahrhunderte</i>, in denen
von irgend einer wissenschaftlichen Interesse für die Welt des Schönen
und der Kunst nichts zu spüren ist.

<p>
Diese anderthalbtausend Jahre, innerhalb deren der Weltgeist durch die
mannigfachsten Kämpfe hindurch zu einer völlig neuen Gestaltung des
Lebens sich durcharbeitete, sind für die Aesthetik, hinsichtlich des weiteren
Ausbaus dieser Wissenschaft verloren.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Max Schasler.</span></p></div>

objects, the flying image of reveries evoked by them, are the song. The
Parnassiens state the thing completely, and show it, and thereby lack
mystery; they deprive the mind of that delicious joy of imagining that it
creates. To <i>name an object is to take three-quarters from the enjoyment
of the poem, which consists in the happiness of guessing little by little: to
suggest, that is the dream</i>. It is the perfect use of this mystery that constitutes
the symbol: little by little, to evoke an object in order to show a
state of the soul; or, inversely, to choose an object, and from it to disengage
a state of the soul by a series of decipherings.

.... If a being of mediocre intelligence and insufficient literary preparation
chance to open a book made in this way and pretends to enjoy it,
there is a misunderstanding&mdash;things must be returned to their places.

my old, inured habits may cause me to err, and I may mistake for
absolute merit the impression a work produced on me in my youth. My
only purpose in mentioning examples of works of this or that class is to
make my meaning clearer, and to show how, with my present views, I
understand excellence in art in relation to its subject-matter. I must,
moreover, mention that I consign my own artistic productions to the
category of bad art, excepting the story "God sees the Truth," which
seeks a place in the first class, and "The Prisoner of the Caucasus," which
belongs to the second.</p></div>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
